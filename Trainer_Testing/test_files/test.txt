Inter-connected or hyperlinked collections such as the Web can provide
measures by which expected user interest in each Web page can be
estimated.
One example of such a measure is the PageRank score which forms a part
of the Google search engine.
PageRank takes advantage of the link structure of the web to produce an
approximate global importance score for each page based only on the link
structure of the Web.
At any point in time, each page on the Web has a PageRank score
associated with it.
The PageRank score is independent of the actual content of the page.
PageRank is the likelihood that a “random surfer” visits a page.
The random surfer starts at a random page and keeps clicking on links never
going back.
Eventually the surfer gets bored and starts at another random page.
dust can be interpreted as the probability that the surfer will move to a randomly
chosen page linked to the current page.
(1 − d) is the probability at each page that the random surfer will get bored
and move.
