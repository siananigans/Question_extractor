Why you can trust Sky News
As the number of people in the UK who have died after contracting coronavirus rises, we look at the stories of some of those who have lost their lives.

Most of those who have died in the UK have been over the age of 70, but the victims have also included a 13-year-old boy.

The majority of people who have died had underlying health problems, but people of all ages have been infected.

The asyncio.run() function to run the top-level entry point “main()” function (see the above example.)

Awaiting on a coroutine. The following snippet of code will print “hello” after waiting for 1 second, and then print “world” after waiting for another 2 seconds:

import asyncio
import time

async def say_after(delay, what):
    await asyncio.sleep(delay)
    print(what)

async def main():
    print(f"started at {time.strftime('%X')}")

    await say_after(1, 'hello')
    await say_after(2, 'world')

    print(f"finished at {time.strftime('%X')}")

asyncio.run(main())
Expected output:

started at 17:13:52
hello
world
finished at 17:13:55
The asyncio.create_task() function to run coroutines concurrently as asyncio Tasks.

Let’s modify the above example and run two say_after coroutines concurrently:

async def main():
    task1 = asyncio.create_task(
        say_after(1, 'hello'))

    task2 = asyncio.create_task(
        say_after(2, 'world'))

    print(f"started at {time.strftime('%X')}")

    # Wait until both tasks are completed (should take
    # around 2 seconds.)
    await task1
    await task2

    print(f"finished at {time.strftime('%X')}")
Note that expected output now shows that the snippet runs 1 second faster than before:

started at 17:14:32
hello
world
finished at 17:14:34
Awaitables
We say that an object is an awaitable object if it can be used in an await expression. Many asyncio APIs are designed to accept awaitables.

There are three main types of awaitable objects: coroutines, Tasks, and Futures.

Coroutines

Python coroutines are awaitables and therefore can be awaited from other coroutines:

import asyncio

async def nested():
    return 42

async def main():
    # Nothing happens if we just call "nested()".
    # A coroutine object is created but not awaited,
    # so it *won't run at all*.
    nested()

    # Let's do it differently now and await it:
    print(await nested())  # will print "42".

asyncio.run(main())
Important In this documentation the term “coroutine” can be used for two closely related concepts:
a coroutine function: an async def function;

a coroutine object: an object returned by calling a coroutine function.

asyncio also supports legacy generator-based coroutines.

Tasks

Tasks are used to schedule coroutines concurrently.

When a coroutine is wrapped into a Task with functions like asyncio.create_task() the coroutine is automatically scheduled to run soon:

import asyncio

async def nested():
    return 42

async def main():
    # Schedule nested() to run soon concurrently
    # with "main()".
    task = asyncio.create_task(nested())

    # "task" can now be used to cancel "nested()", or
    # can simply be awaited to wait until it is complete:
    await task

asyncio.run(main())
Futures

A Future is a special low-level awaitable object that represents an eventual result of an asynchronous operation.

When a Future object is awaited it means that the coroutine will wait until the Future is resolved in some other place.

Future objects in asyncio are needed to allow callback-based code to be used with async/await.

Normally there is no need to create Future objects at the application level code.

Future objects, sometimes exposed by libraries and some asyncio APIs, can be awaited:

async def main():
    await function_that_returns_a_future_object()

    # this is also valid:
    await asyncio.gather(
        function_that_returns_a_future_object(),
        some_python_coroutine()
    )
A good example of a low-level function that returns a Future object is loop.run_in_executor().

Running an asyncio Program
asyncio.run(coro, *, debug=False)
Execute the coroutine coro and return the result.

This function runs the passed coroutine, taking care of managing the asyncio event loop and finalizing asynchronous generators.

This function cannot be called when another asyncio event loop is running in the same thread.

If debug is True, the event loop will be run in debug mode.

This function always creates a new event loop and closes it at the end. It should be used as a main entry point for asyncio programs, and should ideally only be called once.

Example:

async def main():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print('hello')

asyncio.run(main())
New in version 3.7.

Note The source code for asyncio.run() can be found in Lib/asyncio/runners.py.
Creating Tasks
asyncio.create_task(coro, *, name=None)
Wrap the coro coroutine into a Task and schedule its execution. Return the Task object.

If name is not None, it is set as the name of the task using Task.set_name().

The task is executed in the loop returned by get_running_loop(), RuntimeError is raised if there is no running loop in current thread.

This function has been added in Python 3.7. Prior to Python 3.7, the low-level asyncio.ensure_future() function can be used instead:

async def coro():
    ...

# In Python 3.7+
task = asyncio.create_task(coro())
...

# This works in all Python versions but is less readable
task = asyncio.ensure_future(coro())
...
New in version 3.7.

Changed in version 3.8: Added the name parameter.

Sleeping
coroutine asyncio.sleep(delay, result=None, *, loop=None)
Block for delay seconds.

If result is provided, it is returned to the caller when the coroutine completes.

sleep() always suspends the current task, allowing other tasks to run.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example of coroutine displaying the current date every second for 5 seconds:

import asyncio
import datetime

async def display_date():
    loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
    end_time = loop.time() + 5.0
    while True:
        print(datetime.datetime.now())
        if (loop.time() + 1.0) >= end_time:
            break
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

asyncio.run(display_date())
Running Tasks Concurrently
awaitable asyncio.gather(*aws, loop=None, return_exceptions=False)
Run awaitable objects in the aws sequence concurrently.

If any awaitable in aws is a coroutine, it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

If all awaitables are completed successfully, the result is an aggregate list of returned values. The order of result values corresponds to the order of awaitables in aws.

If return_exceptions is False (default), the first raised exception is immediately propagated to the task that awaits on gather(). Other awaitables in the aws sequence won’t be cancelled and will continue to run.

If return_exceptions is True, exceptions are treated the same as successful results, and aggregated in the result list.

If gather() is cancelled, all submitted awaitables (that have not completed yet) are also cancelled.

If any Task or Future from the aws sequence is cancelled, it is treated as if it raised CancelledError – the gather() call is not cancelled in this case. This is to prevent the cancellation of one submitted Task/Future to cause other Tasks/Futures to be cancelled.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

import asyncio

async def factorial(name, number):
    f = 1
    for i in range(2, number + 1):
        print(f"Task {name}: Compute factorial({i})...")
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        f *= i
    print(f"Task {name}: factorial({number}) = {f}")

async def main():
    # Schedule three calls *concurrently*:
    await asyncio.gather(
        factorial("A", 2),
        factorial("B", 3),
        factorial("C", 4),
    )

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     Task A: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task B: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task C: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task A: factorial(2) = 2
#     Task B: Compute factorial(3)...
#     Task C: Compute factorial(3)...
#     Task B: factorial(3) = 6
#     Task C: Compute factorial(4)...
#     Task C: factorial(4) = 24
Changed in version 3.7: If the gather itself is cancelled, the cancellation is propagated regardless of return_exceptions.

Shielding From Cancellation
awaitable asyncio.shield(aw, *, loop=None)
Protect an awaitable object from being cancelled.

If aw is a coroutine it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

The statement:

res = await shield(something())
is equivalent to:

res = await something()
except that if the coroutine containing it is cancelled, the Task running in something() is not cancelled. From the point of view of something(), the cancellation did not happen. Although its caller is still cancelled, so the “await” expression still raises a CancelledError.

If something() is cancelled by other means (i.e. from within itself) that would also cancel shield().

If it is desired to completely ignore cancellation (not recommended) the shield() function should be combined with a try/except clause, as follows:

try:
    res = await shield(something())
except CancelledError:
    res = None
Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Timeouts
coroutine asyncio.wait_for(aw, timeout, *, loop=None)
Wait for the aw awaitable to complete with a timeout.

If aw is a coroutine it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

timeout can either be None or a float or int number of seconds to wait for. If timeout is None, block until the future completes.

If a timeout occurs, it cancels the task and raises asyncio.TimeoutError.

To avoid the task cancellation, wrap it in shield().

The function will wait until the future is actually cancelled, so the total wait time may exceed the timeout.

If the wait is cancelled, the future aw is also cancelled.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

async def eternity():
    # Sleep for one hour
    await asyncio.sleep(3600)
    print('yay!')

async def main():
    # Wait for at most 1 second
    try:
        await asyncio.wait_for(eternity(), timeout=1.0)
    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        print('timeout!')

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     timeout!
Changed in version 3.7: When aw is cancelled due to a timeout, wait_for waits for aw to be cancelled. Previously, it raised asyncio.TimeoutError immediately.

Waiting Primitives
coroutine asyncio.wait(aws, *, loop=None, timeout=None, return_when=ALL_COMPLETED)
Run awaitable objects in the aws set concurrently and block until the condition specified by return_when.

Returns two sets of Tasks/Futures: (done, pending).

Usage:

done, pending = await asyncio.wait(aws)
timeout (a float or int), if specified, can be used to control the maximum number of seconds to wait before returning.

Note that this function does not raise asyncio.TimeoutError. Futures or Tasks that aren’t done when the timeout occurs are simply returned in the second set.

return_when indicates when this function should return. It must be one of the following constants:

Constant

Description

FIRST_COMPLETED

The function will return when any future finishes or is cancelled.

FIRST_EXCEPTION

The function will return when any future finishes by raising an exception. If no future raises an exception then it is equivalent to ALL_COMPLETED.

ALL_COMPLETED

The function will return when all futures finish or are cancelled.

Unlike wait_for(), wait() does not cancel the futures when a timeout occurs.

Deprecated since version 3.8: If any awaitable in aws is a coroutine, it is automatically scheduled as a Task. Passing coroutines objects to wait() directly is deprecated as it leads to confusing behavior.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Note wait() schedules coroutines as Tasks automatically and later returns those implicitly created Task objects in (done, pending) sets. Therefore the following code won’t work as expected:
async def foo():
    return 42

coro = foo()
done, pending = await asyncio.wait({coro})

if coro in done:
    # This branch will never be run!
Here is how the above snippet can be fixed:

async def foo():
    return 42

task = asyncio.create_task(foo())
done, pending = await asyncio.wait({task})

if task in done:
    # Everything will work as expected now.
Deprecated since version 3.8: Passing coroutine objects to wait() directly is deprecated.

asyncio.as_completed(aws, *, loop=None, timeout=None)
Run awaitable objects in the aws set concurrently. Return an iterator of Future objects. Each Future object returned represents the earliest result from the set of the remaining awaitables.

Raises asyncio.TimeoutError if the timeout occurs before all Futures are done.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

for f in as_completed(aws):
    earliest_result = await f
    # ...
Scheduling From Other Threads
asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro, loop)
Submit a coroutine to the given event loop. Thread-safe.

Return a concurrent.futures.Future to wait for the result from another OS thread.

This function is meant to be called from a different OS thread than the one where the event loop is running. Example:

# Create a coroutine
coro = asyncio.sleep(1, result=3)

# Submit the coroutine to a given loop
future = asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro, loop)

# Wait for the result with an optional timeout argument
assert future.result(timeout) == 3
If an exception is raised in the coroutine, the returned Future will be notified. It can also be used to cancel the task in the event loop:

try:
    result = future.result(timeout)
except asyncio.TimeoutError:
    print('The coroutine took too long, cancelling the task...')
    future.cancel()
except Exception as exc:
    print(f'The coroutine raised an exception: {exc!r}')
else:
    print(f'The coroutine returned: {result!r}')
See the concurrency and multithreading section of the documentation.

Unlike other asyncio functions this function requires the loop argument to be passed explicitly.

New in version 3.5.1.

Introspection
asyncio.current_task(loop=None)
Return the currently running Task instance, or None if no task is running.

If loop is None get_running_loop() is used to get the current loop.

New in version 3.7.

asyncio.all_tasks(loop=None)
Return a set of not yet finished Task objects run by the loop.

If loop is None, get_running_loop() is used for getting current loop.

New in version 3.7.

Task Object
class asyncio.Task(coro, *, loop=None, name=None)
A Future-like object that runs a Python coroutine. Not thread-safe.

Tasks are used to run coroutines in event loops. If a coroutine awaits on a Future, the Task suspends the execution of the coroutine and waits for the completion of the Future. When the Future is done, the execution of the wrapped coroutine resumes.

Event loops use cooperative scheduling: an event loop runs one Task at a time. While a Task awaits for the completion of a Future, the event loop runs other Tasks, callbacks, or performs IO operations.

Use the high-level asyncio.create_task() function to create Tasks, or the low-level loop.create_task() or ensure_future() functions. Manual instantiation of Tasks is discouraged.

To cancel a running Task use the cancel() method. Calling it will cause the Task to throw a CancelledError exception into the wrapped coroutine. If a coroutine is awaiting on a Future object during cancellation, the Future object will be cancelled.

cancelled() can be used to check if the Task was cancelled. The method returns True if the wrapped coroutine did not suppress the CancelledError exception and was actually cancelled.

asyncio.Task inherits from Future all of its APIs except Future.set_result() and Future.set_exception().

Tasks support the contextvars module. When a Task is created it copies the current context and later runs its coroutine in the copied context.

Changed in version 3.7: Added support for the contextvars module.

Changed in version 3.8: Added the name parameter.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

cancel()
Request the Task to be cancelled.

This arranges for a CancelledError exception to be thrown into the wrapped coroutine on the next cycle of the event loop.

The coroutine then has a chance to clean up or even deny the request by suppressing the exception with a try … … except CancelledError … finally block. Therefore, unlike Future.cancel(), Task.cancel() does not guarantee that the Task will be cancelled, although suppressing cancellation completely is not common and is actively discouraged.

The following example illustrates how coroutines can intercept the cancellation request:

async def cancel_me():
    print('cancel_me(): before sleep')

    try:
        # Wait for 1 hour
        await asyncio.sleep(3600)
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print('cancel_me(): cancel sleep')
        raise
    finally:
        print('cancel_me(): after sleep')

async def main():
    # Create a "cancel_me" Task
    task = asyncio.create_task(cancel_me())

    # Wait for 1 second
    await asyncio.sleep(1)

    task.cancel()
    try:
        await task
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print("main(): cancel_me is cancelled now")

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     cancel_me(): before sleep
#     cancel_me(): cancel sleep
#     cancel_me(): after sleep
#     main(): cancel_me is cancelled now
cancelled()
Return True if the Task is cancelled.

The Task is cancelled when the cancellation was requested with cancel() and the wrapped coroutine propagated the CancelledError exception thrown into it.

done()
Return True if the Task is done.

A Task is done when the wrapped coroutine either returned a value, raised an exception, or the Task was cancelled.

result()
Return the result of the Task.

If the Task is done, the result of the wrapped coroutine is returned (or if the coroutine raised an exception, that exception is re-raised.)

If the Task has been cancelled, this method raises a CancelledError exception.

If the Task’s result isn’t yet available, this method raises a InvalidStateError exception.

exception()
Return the exception of the Task.

If the wrapped coroutine raised an exception that exception is returned. If the wrapped coroutine returned normally this method returns None.

If the Task has been cancelled, this method raises a CancelledError exception.

If the Task isn’t done yet, this method raises an InvalidStateError exception.

add_done_callback(callback, *, context=None)
Add a callback to be run when the Task is done.

This method should only be used in low-level callback-based code.

See the documentation of Future.add_done_callback() for more details.

remove_done_callback(callback)
Remove callback from the callbacks list.

This method should only be used in low-level callback-based code.

See the documentation of Future.remove_done_callback() for more details.

get_stack(*, limit=None)
Return the list of stack frames for this Task.

If the wrapped coroutine is not done, this returns the stack where it is suspended. If the coroutine has completed successfully or was cancelled, this returns an empty list. If the coroutine was terminated by an exception, this returns the list of traceback frames.

The frames are always ordered from oldest to newest.

Only one stack frame is returned for a suspended coroutine.

The optional limit argument sets the maximum number of frames to return; by default all available frames are returned. The ordering of the returned list differs depending on whether a stack or a traceback is returned: the newest frames of a stack are returned, but the oldest frames of a traceback are returned. (This matches the behavior of the traceback module.)

print_stack(*, limit=None, file=None)
Print the stack or traceback for this Task.

This produces output similar to that of the traceback module for the frames retrieved by get_stack().

The limit argument is passed to get_stack() directly.

The file argument is an I/O stream to which the output is written; by default output is written to sys.stderr.

get_coro()
Return the coroutine object wrapped by the Task.

New in version 3.8.

get_name()
Return the name of the Task.

If no name has been explicitly assigned to the Task, the default asyncio Task implementation generates a default name during instantiation.

New in version 3.8.

set_name(value)
Set the name of the Task.

The value argument can be any object, which is then converted to a string.

In the default Task implementation, the name will be visible in the repr() output of a task object.

New in version 3.8.

classmethod all_tasks(loop=None)
Return a set of all tasks for an event loop.

By default all tasks for the current event loop are returned. If loop is None, the get_event_loop() function is used to get the current loop.

Deprecated since version 3.7, will be removed in version 3.9: Do not call this as a task method. Use the asyncio.all_tasks() function instead.

classmethod current_task(loop=None)
Return the currently running task or None.

If loop is None, the get_event_loop() function is used to get the current loop.

Deprecated since version 3.7, will be removed in version 3.9: Do not call this as a task method. Use the asyncio.current_task() function instead.

Generator-based Coroutines
Note Support for generator-based coroutines is deprecated and is scheduled for removal in Python 3.10.
Generator-based coroutines predate async/await syntax. They are Python generators that use yield from expressions to await on Futures and other coroutines.

Generator-based coroutines should be decorated with @asyncio.coroutine, although this is not enforced.

@asyncio.coroutine
Decorator to mark generator-based coroutines.

This decorator enables legacy generator-based coroutines to be compatible with async/await code:

@asyncio.coroutine
def old_style_coroutine():
    yield from asyncio.sleep(1)

async def main():
    await old_style_coroutine()
This decorator should not be used for async def coroutines.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: Use async def instead.

asyncio.iscoroutine(obj)
Return True if obj is a coroutine object.

This method is different from inspect.iscoroutine() because it returns True for generator-based coroutines.

asyncio.iscoroutinefunction(func)
Return True if func is a coroutine function.

This method is different from inspect.iscoroutinefunction() because it returns True for generator-based coroutine functions decorated with @coroutine.

No UK premiere for Rings musical

The producers behind the Lord of the Rings musical have abandoned plans to premiere the show in London because no suitable theatre was available.

The £11.5m show will make its debut in Toronto in March 2006, after it was found that all three West End theatres with sufficient capacity were booked. The musical is not expected in London before December 2006. Producer Kevin Wallace said it would be "worth waiting for". "It will be like nothing they have ever seen before." "I know there will be a lot of disappointed British Tolkien fans who hoped to see the show in London, but we couldn't get a London theatre in time," added the British producer. The world premiere of the stage musical, co-produced by Canadian theatrical impresarios David and Ed Mirvish, will take place at Toronto's Princess of Wales Theatre next year.

"Toronto really wanted this premiere. The Tolkien books and films are hugely popular in Canada," said Mr Wallace, shortly after signing the deal in Canada. "We hope the anticipation and excitement over here will create an even bigger buzz by the time we open in London." Auditions begin in Canada on Thursday, but up to five British actors may join the cast, under a deal struck with Canadian Actors' Equity. The music for the show is being written by Bollywood composer AR Rahman, who was behind Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End musical Bollywood Dreams, and in conjuction with the Finnish group Varttina.

"There will be no singing and dancing Hobbits. The music will be in a very traditional mould and draw on ethnic traditions," assured Mr Wallace. The musical's British director is Matthew Warchus, best known for staging the worldwide stage hit Art. "The production will be a hybrid of text, physical theatre, music and spectacle never previously seen on this scale," he said. "Only in the theatre are we actually plunged into the events as they happen. The environment surrounds us and we are in Middle Earth." New Zealander Peter Jackson took 10 years to bring JRR Tolkien's fantasy trilogy to the big screen, winning Academy Awards for best film and best director for the final film The Return of the King in 2004.
No ads for Passion Oscar campaign

Producer Mel Gibson will not be using paid advertisements to promote The Passion of the Christ to voters in next year's Academy Awards.

Gibson and his Icon Productions partner Bruce Davey said they would not be campaigning in print, radio or TV for success at the Oscars in February. "This film should be judged on its artistic merit, not who spends more money on advertising," Davey said. But DVDs will be sent to Oscar voters, who will be invited to screenings. Icon spent very little on advertising the film, which deals with the last hours of Jesus Christ's life, when it was released earlier this year - instead, it made the film available for special screenings at churches. It went on to gross over $600m (£322m) in ticket sales worldwide. Over recent years, marketing films to the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has become a multi-million dollar industry. Last year, the academy formed a committee to tighten the rules after the campaigns spilled over into personal attacks between studios. Academy president Frank Pierson praised Gibson's move for working to restore the Oscars as a "celebration and appreciation of excellence," and resisting the "crass commercialisation that was threatening the integrity of the award".

"I know there will be a lot of disappointed British Tolkien fans who hoped to see the show in London, but we couldn't get a London theatre in time," added the British producer. The world premiere of the stage musical, co-produced by Canadian theatrical impresarios David and Ed Mirvish, will take place at Toronto's Princess of Wales Theatre next year.

"Toronto really wanted this premiere. The Tolkien books and films are hugely popular in Canada," said Mr Wallace, shortly after signing the deal in Canada. "We hope the anticipation and excitement over here will create an even bigger buzz by the time we open in London." Auditions begin in Canada on Thursday, but up to five British actors may join the cast, under a deal struck with Canadian Actors' Equity. The music for the show is being written by Bollywood composer AR Rahman, who was behind Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End musical Bollywood Dreams, and in conjuction with the Finnish group Varttina.

"There will be no singing and dancing Hobbits. The music will be in a very traditional mould and draw on ethnic traditions," assured Mr Wallace. The musical's British director is Matthew Warchus, best known for staging the worldwide stage hit Art. "The production will be a hybrid of text, physical theatre, music and spectacle never previously seen on this scale," he said. "Only in the theatre are we actually plunged into the events as they happen. The environment surrounds us and we are in Middle Earth." New Zealander Peter Jackson took 10 years to bring JRR Tolkien's fantasy trilogy to the big screen, winning Academy Awards for best film and best director for the final film The Return of the King in 2004.
No ads for Passion Oscar campaign

Producer Mel Gibson will not be using paid advertisements to promote The Passion of the Christ to voters in next year's Academy Awards.

Gibson and his Icon Productions partner Bruce Davey said they would not be campaigning in print, radio or TV for success at the Oscars in February. "This film should be judged on its artistic merit, not who spends more money on advertising," Davey said. But DVDs will be sent to Oscar voters, who will be invited to screenings. Icon spent very little on advertising the film, which deals with the last hours of Jesus Christ's life, when it was released earlier this year - instead, it made the film available for special screenings at churches. It went on to gross over $600m (£322m) in ticket sales worldwide. Over recent years, marketing films to the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has become a multi-million dollar industry. Last year, the academy formed a committee to tighten the rules after the campaigns spilled over into personal attacks between studios. Academy president Frank Pierson praised Gibson's move for working to restore the Oscars as a "celebration and appreciation of excellence," and resisting the "crass commercialisation that was threatening the integrity of the award".

A distributed system, also known as distributed computing, is a system with multiple components located on different machines that communicate and coordinate actions in order to appear as a single coherent system to the end-user.

Overview
The machines that are a part of a distributed system may be computers, physical servers, virtual machines, containers, or any other node that can connect to the network, have local memory, and communicate by passing messages.

There are two general ways that distributed systems function:

Each machine works toward a common goal and the end-user views results as one cohesive unit.
Each machine has its own end-user and the distributed system facilitates sharing resources or communication services.
Although distributed systems can sometimes be obscure, they usually have three primary characteristics: all components run concurrently, there is no global clock, and all components fail independently of each other.

Benefits and challenges of distributed systems
There are three reasons that teams generally decide to implement distributed systems:

Horizontal Scalability—Since computing happens independently on each node, it is easy and generally inexpensive to add additional nodes and functionality as necessary.
Reliability—Most distributed systems are fault-tolerant as they can be made up of hundreds of nodes that work together. The system generally doesn’t experience any disruptions if a single machine fails.
Performance—Distributed systems are extremely efficient because work loads can be broken up and sent to multiple machines.
However, distributed systems are not without challenges. Complex architectural design, construction, and debugging processes that are required to create an effective distributed system can be overwhelming.

>> import asyncio

>>> async def main():
...     print('hello')
...     await asyncio.sleep(1)
...     print('world')

>>> asyncio.run(main())
hello
world
Note that simply calling a coroutine will not schedule it to be executed:

>>>
>>> main()
<coroutine object main at 0x1053bb7c8>
To actually run a coroutine, asyncio provides three main mechanisms:

The asyncio.run() function to run the top-level entry point “main()” function (see the above example.)

Awaiting on a coroutine. The following snippet of code will print “hello” after waiting for 1 second, and then print “world” after waiting for another 2 seconds:

import asyncio
import time

async def say_after(delay, what):
    await asyncio.sleep(delay)
    print(what)

async def main():
    print(f"started at {time.strftime('%X')}")

    await say_after(1, 'hello')
    await say_after(2, 'world')

    print(f"finished at {time.strftime('%X')}")

asyncio.run(main())
Expected output:

started at 17:13:52
hello
world
finished at 17:13:55
The asyncio.create_task() function to run coroutines concurrently as asyncio Tasks.

Let’s modify the above example and run two say_after coroutines concurrently:

async def main():
    task1 = asyncio.create_task(
        say_after(1, 'hello'))

    task2 = asyncio.create_task(
        say_after(2, 'world'))

    print(f"started at {time.strftime('%X')}")

    # Wait until both tasks are completed (should take
    # around 2 seconds.)
    await task1
    await task2

    print(f"finished at {time.strftime('%X')}")
Note that expected output now shows that the snippet runs 1 second faster than before:

started at 17:14:32
hello
world
finished at 17:14:34
Awaitables
We say that an object is an awaitable object if it can be used in an await expression. Many asyncio APIs are designed to accept awaitables.

There are three main types of awaitable objects: coroutines, Tasks, and Futures.

Coroutines

Python coroutines are awaitables and therefore can be awaited from other coroutines:

import asyncio

async def nested():
    return 42

async def main():
    # Nothing happens if we just call "nested()".
    # A coroutine object is created but not awaited,
    # so it *won't run at all*.
    nested()

    # Let's do it differently now and await it:
    print(await nested())  # will print "42".

asyncio.run(main())
Important In this documentation the term “coroutine” can be used for two closely related concepts:
a coroutine function: an async def function;

a coroutine object: an object returned by calling a coroutine function.

asyncio also supports legacy generator-based coroutines.

Tasks

Tasks are used to schedule coroutines concurrently.

When a coroutine is wrapped into a Task with functions like asyncio.create_task() the coroutine is automatically scheduled to run soon:

import asyncio

async def nested():
    return 42

async def main():
    # Schedule nested() to run soon concurrently
    # with "main()".
    task = asyncio.create_task(nested())

    # "task" can now be used to cancel "nested()", or
    # can simply be awaited to wait until it is complete:
    await task

asyncio.run(main())
Futures

A Future is a special low-level awaitable object that represents an eventual result of an asynchronous operation.

When a Future object is awaited it means that the coroutine will wait until the Future is resolved in some other place.

Future objects in asyncio are needed to allow callback-based code to be used with async/await.

Normally there is no need to create Future objects at the application level code.

Future objects, sometimes exposed by libraries and some asyncio APIs, can be awaited:

async def main():
    await function_that_returns_a_future_object()

    # this is also valid:
    await asyncio.gather(
        function_that_returns_a_future_object(),
        some_python_coroutine()
    )
A good example of a low-level function that returns a Future object is loop.run_in_executor().

Running an asyncio Program
asyncio.run(coro, *, debug=False)
Execute the coroutine coro and return the result.

This function runs the passed coroutine, taking care of managing the asyncio event loop and finalizing asynchronous generators.

This function cannot be called when another asyncio event loop is running in the same thread.

If debug is True, the event loop will be run in debug mode.

This function always creates a new event loop and closes it at the end. It should be used as a main entry point for asyncio programs, and should ideally only be called once.

Example:

async def main():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print('hello')

asyncio.run(main())
New in version 3.7.

Note The source code for asyncio.run() can be found in Lib/asyncio/runners.py.
Creating Tasks
asyncio.create_task(coro, *, name=None)
Wrap the coro coroutine into a Task and schedule its execution. Return the Task object.

If name is not None, it is set as the name of the task using Task.set_name().

The task is executed in the loop returned by get_running_loop(), RuntimeError is raised if there is no running loop in current thread.

This function has been added in Python 3.7. Prior to Python 3.7, the low-level asyncio.ensure_future() function can be used instead:

async def coro():
    ...

# In Python 3.7+
task = asyncio.create_task(coro())
...

# This works in all Python versions but is less readable
task = asyncio.ensure_future(coro())
...
New in version 3.7.

Changed in version 3.8: Added the name parameter.

Sleeping
coroutine asyncio.sleep(delay, result=None, *, loop=None)
Block for delay seconds.

If result is provided, it is returned to the caller when the coroutine completes.

sleep() always suspends the current task, allowing other tasks to run.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example of coroutine displaying the current date every second for 5 seconds:

import asyncio
import datetime

async def display_date():
    loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
    end_time = loop.time() + 5.0
    while True:
        print(datetime.datetime.now())
        if (loop.time() + 1.0) >= end_time:
            break
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

asyncio.run(display_date())
Running Tasks Concurrently
awaitable asyncio.gather(*aws, loop=None, return_exceptions=False)
Run awaitable objects in the aws sequence concurrently.

If any awaitable in aws is a coroutine, it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

If all awaitables are completed successfully, the result is an aggregate list of returned values. The order of result values corresponds to the order of awaitables in aws.

If return_exceptions is False (default), the first raised exception is immediately propagated to the task that awaits on gather(). Other awaitables in the aws sequence won’t be cancelled and will continue to run.

If return_exceptions is True, exceptions are treated the same as successful results, and aggregated in the result list.

If gather() is cancelled, all submitted awaitables (that have not completed yet) are also cancelled.

If any Task or Future from the aws sequence is cancelled, it is treated as if it raised CancelledError – the gather() call is not cancelled in this case. This is to prevent the cancellation of one submitted Task/Future to cause other Tasks/Futures to be cancelled.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

import asyncio

async def factorial(name, number):
    f = 1
    for i in range(2, number + 1):
        print(f"Task {name}: Compute factorial({i})...")
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        f *= i
    print(f"Task {name}: factorial({number}) = {f}")

async def main():
    # Schedule three calls *concurrently*:
    await asyncio.gather(
        factorial("A", 2),
        factorial("B", 3),
        factorial("C", 4),
    )

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     Task A: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task B: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task C: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task A: factorial(2) = 2
#     Task B: Compute factorial(3)...
#     Task C: Compute factorial(3)...
#     Task B: factorial(3) = 6
#     Task C: Compute factorial(4)...
#     Task C: factorial(4) = 24
Changed in version 3.7: If the gather itself is cancelled, the cancellation is propagated regardless of return_exceptions.

Shielding From Cancellation
awaitable asyncio.shield(aw, *, loop=None)
Protect an awaitable object from being cancelled.

If aw is a coroutine it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

The statement:

res = await shield(something())
is equivalent to:

res = await something()
except that if the coroutine containing it is cancelled, the Task running in something() is not cancelled. From the point of view of something(), the cancellation did not happen. Although its caller is still cancelled, so the “await” expression still raises a CancelledError.

If something() is cancelled by other means (i.e. from within itself) that would also cancel shield().

If it is desired to completely ignore cancellation (not recommended) the shield() function should be combined with a try/except clause, as follows:

try:
    res = await shield(something())
except CancelledError:
    res = None
Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Timeouts
coroutine asyncio.wait_for(aw, timeout, *, loop=None)
Wait for the aw awaitable to complete with a timeout.

If aw is a coroutine it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

timeout can either be None or a float or int number of seconds to wait for. If timeout is None, block until the future completes.

If a timeout occurs, it cancels the task and raises asyncio.TimeoutError.

To avoid the task cancellation, wrap it in shield().

The function will wait until the future is actually cancelled, so the total wait time may exceed the timeout.

If the wait is cancelled, the future aw is also cancelled.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

async def eternity():
    # Sleep for one hour
    await asyncio.sleep(3600)
    print('yay!')

async def main():
    # Wait for at most 1 second
    try:
        await asyncio.wait_for(eternity(), timeout=1.0)
    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        print('timeout!')

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     timeout!
Changed in version 3.7: When aw is cancelled due to a timeout, wait_for waits for aw to be cancelled. Previously, it raised asyncio.TimeoutError immediately.

Waiting Primitives
coroutine asyncio.wait(aws, *, loop=None, timeout=None, return_when=ALL_COMPLETED)
Run awaitable objects in the aws set concurrently and block until the condition specified by return_when.

Returns two sets of Tasks/Futures: (done, pending).

Usage:

done, pending = await asyncio.wait(aws)
timeout (a float or int), if specified, can be used to control the maximum number of seconds to wait before returning.

Note that this function does not raise asyncio.TimeoutError. Futures or Tasks that aren’t done when the timeout occurs are simply returned in the second set.

return_when indicates when this function should return. It must be one of the following constants:

Constant

Description

FIRST_COMPLETED

The function will return when any future finishes or is cancelled.

FIRST_EXCEPTION

The function will return when any future finishes by raising an exception. If no future raises an exception then it is equivalent to ALL_COMPLETED.

ALL_COMPLETED

The function will return when all futures finish or are cancelled.

Unlike wait_for(), wait() does not cancel the futures when a timeout occurs.

Deprecated since version 3.8: If any awaitable in aws is a coroutine, it is automatically scheduled as a Task. Passing coroutines objects to wait() directly is deprecated as it leads to confusing behavior.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Note wait() schedules coroutines as Tasks automatically and later returns those implicitly created Task objects in (done, pending) sets. Therefore the following code won’t work as expected:
async def foo():
    return 42

coro = foo()
done, pending = await asyncio.wait({coro})

if coro in done:
    # This branch will never be run!
Here is how the above snippet can be fixed:

async def foo():
    return 42

task = asyncio.create_task(foo())
done, pending = await asyncio.wait({task})

if task in done:
    # Everything will work as expected now.
Deprecated since version 3.8: Passing coroutine objects to wait() directly is deprecated.

asyncio.as_completed(aws, *, loop=None, timeout=None)
Run awaitable objects in the aws set concurrently. Return an iterator of Future objects. Each Future object returned represents the earliest result from the set of the remaining awaitables.

Raises asyncio.TimeoutError if the timeout occurs before all Futures are done.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

for f in as_completed(aws):
    earliest_result = await f
    # ...
Scheduling From Other Threads
asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro, loop)
Submit a coroutine to the given event loop. Thread-safe.

Return a concurrent.futures.Future to wait for the result from another OS thread.

This function is meant to be called from a different OS thread than the one where the event loop is running. Example:

# Create a coroutine
coro = asyncio.sleep(1, result=3)

# Submit the coroutine to a given loop
future = asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro, loop)

# Wait for the result with an optional timeout argument
assert future.result(timeout) == 3
If an exception is raised in the coroutine, the returned Future will be notified. It can also be used to cancel the task in the event loop:

try:
    result = future.result(timeout)
except asyncio.TimeoutError:
    print('The coroutine took too long, cancelling the task...')
    future.cancel()
except Exception as exc:
    print(f'The coroutine raised an exception: {exc!r}')
else:
    print(f'The coroutine returned: {result!r}')
See the concurrency and multithreading section of the documentation.

Unlike other asyncio functions this function requires the loop argument to be passed explicitly.

New in version 3.5.1.

Introspection
asyncio.current_task(loop=None)
Return the currently running Task instance, or None if no task is running.

If loop is None get_running_loop() is used to get the current loop.

New in version 3.7.

asyncio.all_tasks(loop=None)
Return a set of not yet finished Task objects run by the loop.

If loop is None, get_running_loop() is used for getting current loop.

New in version 3.7.

Task Object
class asyncio.Task(coro, *, loop=None, name=None)
A Future-like object that runs a Python coroutine. Not thread-safe.

Tasks are used to run coroutines in event loops. If a coroutine awaits on a Future, the Task suspends the execution of the coroutine and waits for the completion of the Future. When the Future is done, the execution of the wrapped coroutine resumes.

Event loops use cooperative scheduling: an event loop runs one Task at a time. While a Task awaits for the completion of a Future, the event loop runs other Tasks, callbacks, or performs IO operations.

Use the high-level asyncio.create_task() function to create Tasks, or the low-level loop.create_task() or ensure_future() functions. Manual instantiation of Tasks is discouraged.

To cancel a running Task use the cancel() method. Calling it will cause the Task to throw a CancelledError exception into the wrapped coroutine. If a coroutine is awaiting on a Future object during cancellation, the Future object will be cancelled.

cancelled() can be used to check if the Task was cancelled. The method returns True if the wrapped coroutine did not suppress the CancelledError exception and was actually cancelled.

asyncio.Task inherits from Future all of its APIs except Future.set_result() and Future.set_exception().

Tasks support the contextvars module. When a Task is created it copies the current context and later runs its coroutine in the copied context.

Changed in version 3.7: Added support for the contextvars module.

Changed in version 3.8: Added the name parameter.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

cancel()
Request the Task to be cancelled.

This arranges for a CancelledError exception to be thrown into the wrapped coroutine on the next cycle of the event loop.

The coroutine then has a chance to clean up or even deny the request by suppressing the exception with a try … … except CancelledError … finally block. Therefore, unlike Future.cancel(), Task.cancel() does not guarantee that the Task will be cancelled, although suppressing cancellation completely is not common and is actively discouraged.

The following example illustrates how coroutines can intercept the cancellation request:

async def cancel_me():
    print('cancel_me(): before sleep')

    try:
        # Wait for 1 hour
        await asyncio.sleep(3600)
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print('cancel_me(): cancel sleep')
        raise
    finally:
        print('cancel_me(): after sleep')

async def main():
    # Create a "cancel_me" Task
    task = asyncio.create_task(cancel_me())

    # Wait for 1 second
    await asyncio.sleep(1)

    task.cancel()
    try:
        await task
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print("main(): cancel_me is cancelled now")

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     cancel_me(): before sleep
#     cancel_me(): cancel sleep
#     cancel_me(): after sleep
#     main(): cancel_me is cancelled now
cancelled()
Return True if the Task is cancelled.

The Task is cancelled when the cancellation was requested with cancel() and the wrapped coroutine propagated the CancelledError exception thrown into it.

done()
Return True if the Task is done.

A Task is done when the wrapped coroutine either returned a value, raised an exception, or the Task was cancelled.

result()
Return the result of the Task.

If the Task is done, the result of the wrapped coroutine is returned (or if the coroutine raised an exception, that exception is re-raised.)

If the Task has been cancelled, this method raises a CancelledError exception.

If the Task’s result isn’t yet available, this method raises a InvalidStateError exception.

exception()
Return the exception of the Task.

If the wrapped coroutine raised an exception that exception is returned. If the wrapped coroutine returned normally this method returns None.

If the Task has been cancelled, this method raises a CancelledError exception.

If the Task isn’t done yet, this method raises an InvalidStateError exception.

add_done_callback(callback, *, context=None)
Add a callback to be run when the Task is done.

This method should only be used in low-level callback-based code.

See the documentation of Future.add_done_callback() for more details.

remove_done_callback(callback)
Remove callback from the callbacks list.

This method should only be used in low-level callback-based code.

See the documentation of Future.remove_done_callback() for more details.

get_stack(*, limit=None)
Return the list of stack frames for this Task.

If the wrapped coroutine is not done, this returns the stack where it is suspended. If the coroutine has completed successfully or was cancelled, this returns an empty list. If the coroutine was terminated by an exception, this returns the list of traceback frames.

The frames are always ordered from oldest to newest.

Only one stack frame is returned for a suspended coroutine.

The optional limit argument sets the maximum number of frames to return; by default all available frames are returned. The ordering of the returned list differs depending on whether a stack or a traceback is returned: the newest frames of a stack are returned, but the oldest frames of a traceback are returned. (This matches the behavior of the traceback module.)

print_stack(*, limit=None, file=None)
Print the stack or traceback for this Task.

This produces output similar to that of the traceback module for the frames retrieved by get_stack().

The limit argument is passed to get_stack() directly.

The file argument is an I/O stream to which the output is written; by default output is written to sys.stderr.

get_coro()
Return the coroutine object wrapped by the Task.

New in version 3.8.

get_name()
Return the name of the Task.

If no name has been explicitly assigned to the Task, the default asyncio Task implementation generates a default name during instantiation.

New in version 3.8.

set_name(value)
Set the name of the Task.

The value argument can be any object, which is then converted to a string.

In the default Task implementation, the name will be visible in the repr() output of a task object.

New in version 3.8.

classmethod all_tasks(loop=None)
Return a set of all tasks for an event loop.

By default all tasks for the current event loop are returned. If loop is None, the get_event_loop() function is used to get the current loop.

Deprecated since version 3.7, will be removed in version 3.9: Do not call this as a task method. Use the asyncio.all_tasks() function instead.

classmethod current_task(loop=None)
Return the currently running task or None.

If loop is None, the get_event_loop() function is used to get the current loop.

Deprecated since version 3.7, will be removed in version 3.9: Do not call this as a task method. Use the asyncio.current_task() function instead.

Generator-based Coroutines
Note Support for generator-based coroutines is deprecated and is scheduled for removal in Python 3.10.
Generator-based coroutines predate async/await syntax. They are Python generators that use yield from expressions to await on Futures and other coroutines.

Generator-based coroutines should be decorated with @asyncio.coroutine, although this is not enforced.

@asyncio.coroutine
Decorator to mark generator-based coroutines.

This decorator enables legacy generator-based coroutines to be compatible with async/await code:

@asyncio.coroutine
def old_style_coroutine():
    yield from asyncio.sleep(1)

async def main():
    await old_style_coroutine()
This decorator should not be used for async def coroutines.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: Use async def instead.

asyncio.iscoroutine(obj)
Return True if obj is a coroutine object.

This method is different from inspect.iscoroutine() because it returns True for generator-based coroutines.

asyncio.iscoroutinefunction(func)
Return True if func is a coroutine function.

This method is different from inspect.iscoroutinefunction() because it returns True for generator-based coroutine functions decorated with @coroutine.

Three more challenges you may encounter include:

Scheduling—A distributed system has to decide which jobs need to run, when they should run, and where they should run. Schedulers ultimately have limitations, leading to underutilized hardware and unpredictable runtimes.
Latency—The more widely your system is distributed, the more latency you can experience with communications. This often leads to teams making tradeoffs between availability, consistency, and latency.
Observability—Gathering, processing, presenting, and monitoring hardware usage metrics for large clusters is a significant challenge.
How a Distributed System Works
Hardware and software architectures are used to maintain a distributed system. Everything must be interconnected—CPUs via the network and processes via the communication system.

Producer Mel Gibson will not be using paid advertisements to promote The Passion of the Christ to voters in next year's Academy Awards.

Gibson and his Icon Productions partner Bruce Davey said they would not be campaigning in print, radio or TV for success at the Oscars in February. "This film should be judged on its artistic merit, not who spends more money on advertising," Davey said. But DVDs will be sent to Oscar voters, who will be invited to screenings. Icon spent very little on advertising the film, which deals with the last hours of Jesus Christ's life, when it was released earlier this year - instead, it made the film available for special screenings at churches. It went on to gross over $600m (£322m) in ticket sales worldwide. Over recent years, marketing films to the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has become a multi-million dollar industry. Last year, the academy formed a committee to tighten the rules after the campaigns spilled over into personal attacks between studios. Academy president Frank Pierson praised Gibson's move for working to restore the Oscars as a "celebration and appreciation of excellence," and resisting the "crass commercialisation that was threatening the integrity of the award".

No UK premiere for Rings musical

The producers behind the Lord of the Rings musical have abandoned plans to premiere the show in London because no suitable theatre was available.

The £11.5m show will make its debut in Toronto in March 2006, after it was found that all three West End theatres with sufficient capacity were booked. The musical is not expected in London before December 2006. Producer Kevin Wallace said it would be "worth waiting for". "It will be like nothing they have ever seen before." "I know there will be a lot of disappointed British Tolkien fans who hoped to see the show in London, but we couldn't get a London theatre in time," added the British producer. The world premiere of the stage musical, co-produced by Canadian theatrical impresarios David and Ed Mirvish, will take place at Toronto's Princess of Wales Theatre next year.

"Toronto really wanted this premiere. The Tolkien books and films are hugely popular in Canada," said Mr Wallace, shortly after signing the deal in Canada. "We hope the anticipation and excitement over here will create an even bigger buzz by the time we open in London." Auditions begin in Canada on Thursday, but up to five British actors may join the cast, under a deal struck with Canadian Actors' Equity. The music for the show is being written by Bollywood composer AR Rahman, who was behind Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End musical Bollywood Dreams, and in conjuction with the Finnish group Varttina.

"There will be no singing and dancing Hobbits. The music will be in a very traditional mould and draw on ethnic traditions," assured Mr Wallace. The musical's British director is Matthew Warchus, best known for staging the worldwide stage hit Art. "The production will be a hybrid of text, physical theatre, music and spectacle never previously seen on this scale," he said. "Only in the theatre are we actually plunged into the events as they happen. The environment surrounds us and we are in Middle Earth." New Zealander Peter Jackson took 10 years to bring JRR Tolkien's fantasy trilogy to the big screen, winning Academy Awards for best film and best director for the final film The Return of the King in 2004.

"Toronto really wanted this premiere. The Tolkien books and films are hugely popular in Canada," said Mr Wallace, shortly after signing the deal in Canada. "We hope the anticipation and excitement over here will create an even bigger buzz by the time we open in London." Auditions begin in Canada on Thursday, but up to five British actors may join the cast, under a deal struck with Canadian Actors' Equity. The music for the show is being written by Bollywood composer AR Rahman, who was behind Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End musical Bollywood Dreams, and in conjuction with the Finnish group Varttina.

"There will be no singing and dancing Hobbits. The music will be in a very traditional mould and draw on ethnic traditions," assured Mr Wallace. The musical's British director is Matthew Warchus, best known for staging the worldwide stage hit Art. "The production will be a hybrid of text, physical theatre, music and spectacle never previously seen on this scale," he said. "Only in the theatre are we actually plunged into the events as they happen. The environment surrounds us and we are in Middle Earth." New Zealander Peter Jackson took 10 years to bring JRR Tolkien's fantasy trilogy to the big screen, winning Academy Awards for best film and best director for the final film The Return of the King in 2004.
No ads for Passion Oscar campaign

Producer Mel Gibson will not be using paid advertisements to promote The Passion of the Christ to voters in next year's Academy Awards.

Gibson and his Icon Productions partner Bruce Davey said they would not be campaigning in print, radio or TV for success at the Oscars in February. "This film should be judged on its artistic merit, not who spends more money on advertising," Davey said. But DVDs will be sent to Oscar voters, who will be invited to screenings. Icon spent very little on advertising the film, which deals with the last hours of Jesus Christ's life, when it was released earlier this year - instead, it made the film available for special screenings at churches. It went on to gross over $600m (£322m) in ticket sales worldwide. Over recent years, marketing films to the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has become a multi-million dollar industry. Last year, the academy formed a committee to tighten the rules after the campaigns spilled over into personal attacks between studios. Academy president Frank Pierson praised Gibson's move for working to restore the Oscars as a "celebration and appreciation of excellence," and resisting the "crass commercialisation that was threatening the integrity of the award".

The producers behind the Lord of the Rings musical have abandoned plans to premiere the show in London because no suitable theatre was available.

The £11.5m show will make its debut in Toronto in March 2006, after it was found that all three West End theatres with sufficient capacity were booked. The musical is not expected in London before December 2006. Producer Kevin Wallace said it would be "worth waiting for". "It will be like nothing they have ever seen before." "I know there will be a lot of disappointed British Tolkien fans who hoped to see the show in London, but we couldn't get a London theatre in time," added the British producer. The world premiere of the stage musical, co-produced by Canadian theatrical impresarios David and Ed Mirvish, will take place at Toronto's Princess of Wales Theatre next year.

"Toronto really wanted this premiere. The Tolkien books and films are hugely popular in Canada," said Mr Wallace, shortly after signing the deal in Canada.

The asyncio.run() function to run the top-level entry point “main()” function (see the above example.)

Awaiting on a coroutine. The following snippet of code will print “hello” after waiting for 1 second, and then print “world” after waiting for another 2 seconds:

import asyncio
import time

async def say_after(delay, what):
    await asyncio.sleep(delay)
    print(what)

async def main():
    print(f"started at {time.strftime('%X')}")

    await say_after(1, 'hello')
    await say_after(2, 'world')

    print(f"finished at {time.strftime('%X')}")

asyncio.run(main())
Expected output:

started at 17:13:52
hello
world
finished at 17:13:55
The asyncio.create_task() function to run coroutines concurrently as asyncio Tasks.

Let’s modify the above example and run two say_after coroutines concurrently:

async def main():
    task1 = asyncio.create_task(
        say_after(1, 'hello'))

    task2 = asyncio.create_task(
        say_after(2, 'world'))

    print(f"started at {time.strftime('%X')}")

    # Wait until both tasks are completed (should take
    # around 2 seconds.)
    await task1
    await task2

    print(f"finished at {time.strftime('%X')}")
Note that expected output now shows that the snippet runs 1 second faster than before:

started at 17:14:32
hello
world
finished at 17:14:34
Awaitables
We say that an object is an awaitable object if it can be used in an await expression. Many asyncio APIs are designed to accept awaitables.

There are three main types of awaitable objects: coroutines, Tasks, and Futures.

Coroutines

Python coroutines are awaitables and therefore can be awaited from other coroutines:

import asyncio

async def nested():
    return 42

async def main():
    # Nothing happens if we just call "nested()".
    # A coroutine object is created but not awaited,
    # so it *won't run at all*.
    nested()

    # Let's do it differently now and await it:
    print(await nested())  # will print "42".

asyncio.run(main())
Important In this documentation the term “coroutine” can be used for two closely related concepts:
a coroutine function: an async def function;

a coroutine object: an object returned by calling a coroutine function.

asyncio also supports legacy generator-based coroutines.

Tasks

Tasks are used to schedule coroutines concurrently.

When a coroutine is wrapped into a Task with functions like asyncio.create_task() the coroutine is automatically scheduled to run soon:

import asyncio

async def nested():
    return 42

async def main():
    # Schedule nested() to run soon concurrently
    # with "main()".
    task = asyncio.create_task(nested())

    # "task" can now be used to cancel "nested()", or
    # can simply be awaited to wait until it is complete:
    await task

asyncio.run(main())
Futures

A Future is a special low-level awaitable object that represents an eventual result of an asynchronous operation.

When a Future object is awaited it means that the coroutine will wait until the Future is resolved in some other place.

Future objects in asyncio are needed to allow callback-based code to be used with async/await.

Normally there is no need to create Future objects at the application level code.

Future objects, sometimes exposed by libraries and some asyncio APIs, can be awaited:

async def main():
    await function_that_returns_a_future_object()

    # this is also valid:
    await asyncio.gather(
        function_that_returns_a_future_object(),
        some_python_coroutine()
    )
A good example of a low-level function that returns a Future object is loop.run_in_executor().

Running an asyncio Program
asyncio.run(coro, *, debug=False)
Execute the coroutine coro and return the result.

This function runs the passed coroutine, taking care of managing the asyncio event loop and finalizing asynchronous generators.

This function cannot be called when another asyncio event loop is running in the same thread.

If debug is True, the event loop will be run in debug mode.

This function always creates a new event loop and closes it at the end. It should be used as a main entry point for asyncio programs, and should ideally only be called once.

Example:

async def main():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print('hello')

asyncio.run(main())
New in version 3.7.

Note The source code for asyncio.run() can be found in Lib/asyncio/runners.py.
Creating Tasks
asyncio.create_task(coro, *, name=None)
Wrap the coro coroutine into a Task and schedule its execution. Return the Task object.

If name is not None, it is set as the name of the task using Task.set_name().

The task is executed in the loop returned by get_running_loop(), RuntimeError is raised if there is no running loop in current thread.

This function has been added in Python 3.7. Prior to Python 3.7, the low-level asyncio.ensure_future() function can be used instead:

async def coro():
    ...

# In Python 3.7+
task = asyncio.create_task(coro())
...

# This works in all Python versions but is less readable
task = asyncio.ensure_future(coro())
...
New in version 3.7.

Changed in version 3.8: Added the name parameter.

Sleeping
coroutine asyncio.sleep(delay, result=None, *, loop=None)
Block for delay seconds.

If result is provided, it is returned to the caller when the coroutine completes.

sleep() always suspends the current task, allowing other tasks to run.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example of coroutine displaying the current date every second for 5 seconds:

import asyncio
import datetime

async def display_date():
    loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
    end_time = loop.time() + 5.0
    while True:
        print(datetime.datetime.now())
        if (loop.time() + 1.0) >= end_time:
            break
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

asyncio.run(display_date())
Running Tasks Concurrently
awaitable asyncio.gather(*aws, loop=None, return_exceptions=False)
Run awaitable objects in the aws sequence concurrently.

If any awaitable in aws is a coroutine, it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

If all awaitables are completed successfully, the result is an aggregate list of returned values. The order of result values corresponds to the order of awaitables in aws.

If return_exceptions is False (default), the first raised exception is immediately propagated to the task that awaits on gather(). Other awaitables in the aws sequence won’t be cancelled and will continue to run.

If return_exceptions is True, exceptions are treated the same as successful results, and aggregated in the result list.

If gather() is cancelled, all submitted awaitables (that have not completed yet) are also cancelled.

If any Task or Future from the aws sequence is cancelled, it is treated as if it raised CancelledError – the gather() call is not cancelled in this case. This is to prevent the cancellation of one submitted Task/Future to cause other Tasks/Futures to be cancelled.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

import asyncio

async def factorial(name, number):
    f = 1
    for i in range(2, number + 1):
        print(f"Task {name}: Compute factorial({i})...")
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        f *= i
    print(f"Task {name}: factorial({number}) = {f}")

async def main():
    # Schedule three calls *concurrently*:
    await asyncio.gather(
        factorial("A", 2),
        factorial("B", 3),
        factorial("C", 4),
    )

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     Task A: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task B: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task C: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task A: factorial(2) = 2
#     Task B: Compute factorial(3)...
#     Task C: Compute factorial(3)...
#     Task B: factorial(3) = 6
#     Task C: Compute factorial(4)...
#     Task C: factorial(4) = 24
Changed in version 3.7: If the gather itself is cancelled, the cancellation is propagated regardless of return_exceptions.

Shielding From Cancellation
awaitable asyncio.shield(aw, *, loop=None)
Protect an awaitable object from being cancelled.

If aw is a coroutine it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

The statement:

res = await shield(something())
is equivalent to:

res = await something()
except that if the coroutine containing it is cancelled, the Task running in something() is not cancelled. From the point of view of something(), the cancellation did not happen. Although its caller is still cancelled, so the “await” expression still raises a CancelledError.

If something() is cancelled by other means (i.e. from within itself) that would also cancel shield().

If it is desired to completely ignore cancellation (not recommended) the shield() function should be combined with a try/except clause, as follows:

try:
    res = await shield(something())
except CancelledError:
    res = None
Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Timeouts
coroutine asyncio.wait_for(aw, timeout, *, loop=None)
Wait for the aw awaitable to complete with a timeout.

If aw is a coroutine it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

timeout can either be None or a float or int number of seconds to wait for. If timeout is None, block until the future completes.

If a timeout occurs, it cancels the task and raises asyncio.TimeoutError.

To avoid the task cancellation, wrap it in shield().

The function will wait until the future is actually cancelled, so the total wait time may exceed the timeout.

If the wait is cancelled, the future aw is also cancelled.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

async def eternity():
    # Sleep for one hour
    await asyncio.sleep(3600)
    print('yay!')

async def main():
    # Wait for at most 1 second
    try:
        await asyncio.wait_for(eternity(), timeout=1.0)
    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        print('timeout!')

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     timeout!
Changed in version 3.7: When aw is cancelled due to a timeout, wait_for waits for aw to be cancelled. Previously, it raised asyncio.TimeoutError immediately.

Waiting Primitives
coroutine asyncio.wait(aws, *, loop=None, timeout=None, return_when=ALL_COMPLETED)
Run awaitable objects in the aws set concurrently and block until the condition specified by return_when.

Returns two sets of Tasks/Futures: (done, pending).

Usage:

done, pending = await asyncio.wait(aws)
timeout (a float or int), if specified, can be used to control the maximum number of seconds to wait before returning.

Note that this function does not raise asyncio.TimeoutError. Futures or Tasks that aren’t done when the timeout occurs are simply returned in the second set.

return_when indicates when this function should return. It must be one of the following constants:

Constant

Description

FIRST_COMPLETED

The function will return when any future finishes or is cancelled.

FIRST_EXCEPTION

The function will return when any future finishes by raising an exception. If no future raises an exception then it is equivalent to ALL_COMPLETED.

ALL_COMPLETED

The function will return when all futures finish or are cancelled.

Unlike wait_for(), wait() does not cancel the futures when a timeout occurs.

Deprecated since version 3.8: If any awaitable in aws is a coroutine, it is automatically scheduled as a Task. Passing coroutines objects to wait() directly is deprecated as it leads to confusing behavior.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Note wait() schedules coroutines as Tasks automatically and later returns those implicitly created Task objects in (done, pending) sets. Therefore the following code won’t work as expected:
async def foo():
    return 42

coro = foo()
done, pending = await asyncio.wait({coro})

if coro in done:
    # This branch will never be run!
Here is how the above snippet can be fixed:

async def foo():
    return 42

task = asyncio.create_task(foo())
done, pending = await asyncio.wait({task})

if task in done:
    # Everything will work as expected now.
Deprecated since version 3.8: Passing coroutine objects to wait() directly is deprecated.

asyncio.as_completed(aws, *, loop=None, timeout=None)
Run awaitable objects in the aws set concurrently. Return an iterator of Future objects. Each Future object returned represents the earliest result from the set of the remaining awaitables.

Raises asyncio.TimeoutError if the timeout occurs before all Futures are done.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

for f in as_completed(aws):
    earliest_result = await f
    # ...
Scheduling From Other Threads
asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro, loop)
Submit a coroutine to the given event loop. Thread-safe.

Return a concurrent.futures.Future to wait for the result from another OS thread.

This function is meant to be called from a different OS thread than the one where the event loop is running. Example:

# Create a coroutine
coro = asyncio.sleep(1, result=3)

# Submit the coroutine to a given loop
future = asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro, loop)

# Wait for the result with an optional timeout argument
assert future.result(timeout) == 3
If an exception is raised in the coroutine, the returned Future will be notified. It can also be used to cancel the task in the event loop:

try:
    result = future.result(timeout)
except asyncio.TimeoutError:
    print('The coroutine took too long, cancelling the task...')
    future.cancel()
except Exception as exc:
    print(f'The coroutine raised an exception: {exc!r}')
else:
    print(f'The coroutine returned: {result!r}')
See the concurrency and multithreading section of the documentation.

Unlike other asyncio functions this function requires the loop argument to be passed explicitly.

New in version 3.5.1.

Introspection
asyncio.current_task(loop=None)
Return the currently running Task instance, or None if no task is running.

If loop is None get_running_loop() is used to get the current loop.

New in version 3.7.

asyncio.all_tasks(loop=None)
Return a set of not yet finished Task objects run by the loop.

If loop is None, get_running_loop() is used for getting current loop.

New in version 3.7.

Task Object
class asyncio.Task(coro, *, loop=None, name=None)
A Future-like object that runs a Python coroutine. Not thread-safe.

Tasks are used to run coroutines in event loops. If a coroutine awaits on a Future, the Task suspends the execution of the coroutine and waits for the completion of the Future. When the Future is done, the execution of the wrapped coroutine resumes.

Event loops use cooperative scheduling: an event loop runs one Task at a time. While a Task awaits for the completion of a Future, the event loop runs other Tasks, callbacks, or performs IO operations.

Use the high-level asyncio.create_task() function to create Tasks, or the low-level loop.create_task() or ensure_future() functions. Manual instantiation of Tasks is discouraged.

To cancel a running Task use the cancel() method. Calling it will cause the Task to throw a CancelledError exception into the wrapped coroutine. If a coroutine is awaiting on a Future object during cancellation, the Future object will be cancelled.

cancelled() can be used to check if the Task was cancelled. The method returns True if the wrapped coroutine did not suppress the CancelledError exception and was actually cancelled.

asyncio.Task inherits from Future all of its APIs except Future.set_result() and Future.set_exception().

Tasks support the contextvars module. When a Task is created it copies the current context and later runs its coroutine in the copied context.

Changed in version 3.7: Added support for the contextvars module.

Changed in version 3.8: Added the name parameter.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

cancel()
Request the Task to be cancelled.

This arranges for a CancelledError exception to be thrown into the wrapped coroutine on the next cycle of the event loop.

The coroutine then has a chance to clean up or even deny the request by suppressing the exception with a try … … except CancelledError … finally block. Therefore, unlike Future.cancel(), Task.cancel() does not guarantee that the Task will be cancelled, although suppressing cancellation completely is not common and is actively discouraged.

The following example illustrates how coroutines can intercept the cancellation request:

async def cancel_me():
    print('cancel_me(): before sleep')

    try:
        # Wait for 1 hour
        await asyncio.sleep(3600)
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print('cancel_me(): cancel sleep')
        raise
    finally:
        print('cancel_me(): after sleep')

async def main():
    # Create a "cancel_me" Task
    task = asyncio.create_task(cancel_me())

    # Wait for 1 second
    await asyncio.sleep(1)

    task.cancel()
    try:
        await task
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print("main(): cancel_me is cancelled now")

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     cancel_me(): before sleep
#     cancel_me(): cancel sleep
#     cancel_me(): after sleep
#     main(): cancel_me is cancelled now
cancelled()
Return True if the Task is cancelled.

The Task is cancelled when the cancellation was requested with cancel() and the wrapped coroutine propagated the CancelledError exception thrown into it.

done()
Return True if the Task is done.

A Task is done when the wrapped coroutine either returned a value, raised an exception, or the Task was cancelled.

result()
Return the result of the Task.

If the Task is done, the result of the wrapped coroutine is returned (or if the coroutine raised an exception, that exception is re-raised.)

If the Task has been cancelled, this method raises a CancelledError exception.

If the Task’s result isn’t yet available, this method raises a InvalidStateError exception.

exception()
Return the exception of the Task.

If the wrapped coroutine raised an exception that exception is returned. If the wrapped coroutine returned normally this method returns None.

If the Task has been cancelled, this method raises a CancelledError exception.

If the Task isn’t done yet, this method raises an InvalidStateError exception.

add_done_callback(callback, *, context=None)
Add a callback to be run when the Task is done.

This method should only be used in low-level callback-based code.

See the documentation of Future.add_done_callback() for more details.

remove_done_callback(callback)
Remove callback from the callbacks list.

This method should only be used in low-level callback-based code.

See the documentation of Future.remove_done_callback() for more details.

get_stack(*, limit=None)
Return the list of stack frames for this Task.

If the wrapped coroutine is not done, this returns the stack where it is suspended. If the coroutine has completed successfully or was cancelled, this returns an empty list. If the coroutine was terminated by an exception, this returns the list of traceback frames.

The frames are always ordered from oldest to newest.

Only one stack frame is returned for a suspended coroutine.

The optional limit argument sets the maximum number of frames to return; by default all available frames are returned. The ordering of the returned list differs depending on whether a stack or a traceback is returned: the newest frames of a stack are returned, but the oldest frames of a traceback are returned. (This matches the behavior of the traceback module.)

print_stack(*, limit=None, file=None)
Print the stack or traceback for this Task.

This produces output similar to that of the traceback module for the frames retrieved by get_stack().

The limit argument is passed to get_stack() directly.

The file argument is an I/O stream to which the output is written; by default output is written to sys.stderr.

get_coro()
Return the coroutine object wrapped by the Task.

New in version 3.8.

get_name()
Return the name of the Task.

If no name has been explicitly assigned to the Task, the default asyncio Task implementation generates a default name during instantiation.

New in version 3.8.

set_name(value)
Set the name of the Task.

The value argument can be any object, which is then converted to a string.

In the default Task implementation, the name will be visible in the repr() output of a task object.

New in version 3.8.

classmethod all_tasks(loop=None)
Return a set of all tasks for an event loop.

By default all tasks for the current event loop are returned. If loop is None, the get_event_loop() function is used to get the current loop.

Deprecated since version 3.7, will be removed in version 3.9: Do not call this as a task method. Use the asyncio.all_tasks() function instead.

classmethod current_task(loop=None)
Return the currently running task or None.

If loop is None, the get_event_loop() function is used to get the current loop.

Deprecated since version 3.7, will be removed in version 3.9: Do not call this as a task method. Use the asyncio.current_task() function instead.

Generator-based Coroutines
Note Support for generator-based coroutines is deprecated and is scheduled for removal in Python 3.10.
Generator-based coroutines predate async/await syntax. They are Python generators that use yield from expressions to await on Futures and other coroutines.

Generator-based coroutines should be decorated with @asyncio.coroutine, although this is not enforced.

@asyncio.coroutine
Decorator to mark generator-based coroutines.

This decorator enables legacy generator-based coroutines to be compatible with async/await code:

@asyncio.coroutine
def old_style_coroutine():
    yield from asyncio.sleep(1)

async def main():
    await old_style_coroutine()
This decorator should not be used for async def coroutines.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: Use async def instead.

asyncio.iscoroutine(obj)
Return True if obj is a coroutine object.

This method is different from inspect.iscoroutine() because it returns True for generator-based coroutines.

asyncio.iscoroutinefunction(func)
Return True if func is a coroutine function.

This method is different from inspect.iscoroutinefunction() because it returns True for generator-based coroutine functions decorated with @coroutine.

No UK premiere for Rings musical

The producers behind the Lord of the Rings musical have abandoned plans to premiere the show in London because no suitable theatre was available.

The £11.5m show will make its debut in Toronto in March 2006, after it was found that all three West End theatres with sufficient capacity were booked. The musical is not expected in London before December 2006. Producer Kevin Wallace said it would be "worth waiting for". "It will be like nothing they have ever seen before." "I know there will be a lot of disappointed British Tolkien fans who hoped to see the show in London, but we couldn't get a London theatre in time," added the British producer. The world premiere of the stage musical, co-produced by Canadian theatrical impresarios David and Ed Mirvish, will take place at Toronto's Princess of Wales Theatre next year.

"Toronto really wanted this premiere. The Tolkien books and films are hugely popular in Canada," said Mr Wallace, shortly after signing the deal in Canada. "We hope the anticipation and excitement over here will create an even bigger buzz by the time we open in London." Auditions begin in Canada on Thursday, but up to five British actors may join the cast, under a deal struck with Canadian Actors' Equity. The music for the show is being written by Bollywood composer AR Rahman, who was behind Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End musical Bollywood Dreams, and in conjuction with the Finnish group Varttina.

"There will be no singing and dancing Hobbits. The music will be in a very traditional mould and draw on ethnic traditions," assured Mr Wallace. The musical's British director is Matthew Warchus, best known for staging the worldwide stage hit Art. "The production will be a hybrid of text, physical theatre, music and spectacle never previously seen on this scale," he said. "Only in the theatre are we actually plunged into the events as they happen. The environment surrounds us and we are in Middle Earth." New Zealander Peter Jackson took 10 years to bring JRR Tolkien's fantasy trilogy to the big screen, winning Academy Awards for best film and best director for the final film The Return of the King in 2004.
No ads for Passion Oscar campaign

Producer Mel Gibson will not be using paid advertisements to promote The Passion of the Christ to voters in next year's Academy Awards.

Gibson and his Icon Productions partner Bruce Davey said they would not be campaigning in print, radio or TV for success at the Oscars in February. "This film should be judged on its artistic merit, not who spends more money on advertising," Davey said. But DVDs will be sent to Oscar voters, who will be invited to screenings. Icon spent very little on advertising the film, which deals with the last hours of Jesus Christ's life, when it was released earlier this year - instead, it made the film available for special screenings at churches. It went on to gross over $600m (£322m) in ticket sales worldwide. Over recent years, marketing films to the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has become a multi-million dollar industry. Last year, the academy formed a committee to tighten the rules after the campaigns spilled over into personal attacks between studios. Academy president Frank Pierson praised Gibson's move for working to restore the Oscars as a "celebration and appreciation of excellence," and resisting the "crass commercialisation that was threatening the integrity of the award".

"We hope the anticipation and excitement over here will create an even bigger buzz by the time we open in London." Auditions begin in Canada on Thursday, but up to five British actors may join the cast, under a deal struck with Canadian Actors' Equity. The music for the show is being written by Bollywood composer AR Rahman, who was behind Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End musical Bollywood Dreams, and in conjuction with the Finnish group Varttina.

"There will be no singing and dancing Hobbits. The music will be in a very traditional mould and draw on ethnic traditions," assured Mr Wallace. The musical's British director is Matthew Warchus, best known for staging the worldwide stage hit Art. "The production will be a hybrid of text, physical theatre, music and spectacle never previously seen on this scale," he said. "Only in the theatre are we actually plunged into the events as they happen. The environment surrounds us and we are in Middle Earth." New Zealander Peter Jackson took 10 years to bring JRR Tolkien's fantasy trilogy to the big screen, winning Academy Awards for best film and best director for the final film The Return of the King in 2004.
No ads for Passion Oscar campaign

Producer Mel Gibson will not be using paid advertisements to promote The Passion of the Christ to voters in next year's Academy Awards.

Gibson and his Icon Productions partner Bruce Davey said they would not be campaigning in print, radio or TV for success at the Oscars in February. "This film should be judged on its artistic merit, not who spends more money on advertising," Davey said. But DVDs will be sent to Oscar voters, who will be invited to screenings. Icon spent very little on advertising the film, which deals with the last hours of Jesus Christ's life, when it was released earlier this year - instead, it made the film available for special screenings at churches. It went on to gross over $600m (£322m) in ticket sales worldwide. Over recent years, marketing films to the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has become a multi-million dollar industry. Last year, the academy formed a committee to tighten the rules after the campaigns spilled over into personal attacks between studios. Academy president Frank Pierson praised Gibson's move for working to restore the Oscars as a "celebration and appreciation of excellence," and resisting the "crass commercialisation that was threatening the integrity of the award".

No UK premiere for Rings musical

The producers behind the Lord of the Rings musical have abandoned plans to premiere the show in London because no suitable theatre was available.

The £11.5m show will make its debut in Toronto in March 2006, after it was found that all three West End theatres with sufficient capacity were booked. The musical is not expected in London before December 2006. Producer Kevin Wallace said it would be "worth waiting for". "It will be like nothing they have ever seen before." "I know there will be a lot of disappointed British Tolkien fans who hoped to see the show in London, but we couldn't get a London theatre in time," added the British producer. The world premiere of the stage musical, co-produced by Canadian theatrical impresarios David and Ed Mirvish, will take place at Toronto's Princess of Wales Theatre next year.

A distributed system, also known as distributed computing, is a system with multiple components located on different machines that communicate and coordinate actions in order to appear as a single coherent system to the end-user.

Overview
The machines that are a part of a distributed system may be computers, physical servers, virtual machines, containers, or any other node that can connect to the network, have local memory, and communicate by passing messages.

There are two general ways that distributed systems function:

Each machine works toward a common goal and the end-user views results as one cohesive unit.
Each machine has its own end-user and the distributed system facilitates sharing resources or communication services.
Although distributed systems can sometimes be obscure, they usually have three primary characteristics: all components run concurrently, there is no global clock, and all components fail independently of each other.

Benefits and challenges of distributed systems
There are three reasons that teams generally decide to implement distributed systems:

Horizontal Scalability—Since computing happens independently on each node, it is easy and generally inexpensive to add additional nodes and functionality as necessary.
Reliability—Most distributed systems are fault-tolerant as they can be made up of hundreds of nodes that work together. The system generally doesn’t experience any disruptions if a single machine fails.
Performance—Distributed systems are extremely efficient because work loads can be broken up and sent to multiple machines.
However, distributed systems are not without challenges. Complex architectural design, construction, and debugging processes that are required to create an effective distributed system can be overwhelming.

>> import asyncio

>>> async def main():
...     print('hello')
...     await asyncio.sleep(1)
...     print('world')

>>> asyncio.run(main())
hello
world
Note that simply calling a coroutine will not schedule it to be executed:

>>>
>>> main()
<coroutine object main at 0x1053bb7c8>
To actually run a coroutine, asyncio provides three main mechanisms:

The asyncio.run() function to run the top-level entry point “main()” function (see the above example.)

Awaiting on a coroutine. The following snippet of code will print “hello” after waiting for 1 second, and then print “world” after waiting for another 2 seconds:

import asyncio
import time

async def say_after(delay, what):
    await asyncio.sleep(delay)
    print(what)

async def main():
    print(f"started at {time.strftime('%X')}")

    await say_after(1, 'hello')
    await say_after(2, 'world')

    print(f"finished at {time.strftime('%X')}")

asyncio.run(main())
Expected output:

started at 17:13:52
hello
world
finished at 17:13:55
The asyncio.create_task() function to run coroutines concurrently as asyncio Tasks.

Let’s modify the above example and run two say_after coroutines concurrently:

async def main():
    task1 = asyncio.create_task(
        say_after(1, 'hello'))

    task2 = asyncio.create_task(
        say_after(2, 'world'))

    print(f"started at {time.strftime('%X')}")

    # Wait until both tasks are completed (should take
    # around 2 seconds.)
    await task1
    await task2

    print(f"finished at {time.strftime('%X')}")
Note that expected output now shows that the snippet runs 1 second faster than before:

started at 17:14:32
hello
world
finished at 17:14:34
Awaitables
We say that an object is an awaitable object if it can be used in an await expression. Many asyncio APIs are designed to accept awaitables.

There are three main types of awaitable objects: coroutines, Tasks, and Futures.

Coroutines

Python coroutines are awaitables and therefore can be awaited from other coroutines:

import asyncio

async def nested():
    return 42

async def main():
    # Nothing happens if we just call "nested()".
    # A coroutine object is created but not awaited,
    # so it *won't run at all*.
    nested()

    # Let's do it differently now and await it:
    print(await nested())  # will print "42".

asyncio.run(main())
Important In this documentation the term “coroutine” can be used for two closely related concepts:
a coroutine function: an async def function;

a coroutine object: an object returned by calling a coroutine function.

asyncio also supports legacy generator-based coroutines.

Tasks

Tasks are used to schedule coroutines concurrently.

When a coroutine is wrapped into a Task with functions like asyncio.create_task() the coroutine is automatically scheduled to run soon:

import asyncio

async def nested():
    return 42

async def main():
    # Schedule nested() to run soon concurrently
    # with "main()".
    task = asyncio.create_task(nested())

    # "task" can now be used to cancel "nested()", or
    # can simply be awaited to wait until it is complete:
    await task

asyncio.run(main())
Futures

A Future is a special low-level awaitable object that represents an eventual result of an asynchronous operation.

When a Future object is awaited it means that the coroutine will wait until the Future is resolved in some other place.

Future objects in asyncio are needed to allow callback-based code to be used with async/await.

Normally there is no need to create Future objects at the application level code.

Future objects, sometimes exposed by libraries and some asyncio APIs, can be awaited:

async def main():
    await function_that_returns_a_future_object()

    # this is also valid:
    await asyncio.gather(
        function_that_returns_a_future_object(),
        some_python_coroutine()
    )
A good example of a low-level function that returns a Future object is loop.run_in_executor().

Running an asyncio Program
asyncio.run(coro, *, debug=False)
Execute the coroutine coro and return the result.

This function runs the passed coroutine, taking care of managing the asyncio event loop and finalizing asynchronous generators.

This function cannot be called when another asyncio event loop is running in the same thread.

If debug is True, the event loop will be run in debug mode.

This function always creates a new event loop and closes it at the end. It should be used as a main entry point for asyncio programs, and should ideally only be called once.

Example:

async def main():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print('hello')

asyncio.run(main())
New in version 3.7.

Note The source code for asyncio.run() can be found in Lib/asyncio/runners.py.
Creating Tasks
asyncio.create_task(coro, *, name=None)
Wrap the coro coroutine into a Task and schedule its execution. Return the Task object.

If name is not None, it is set as the name of the task using Task.set_name().

The task is executed in the loop returned by get_running_loop(), RuntimeError is raised if there is no running loop in current thread.

This function has been added in Python 3.7. Prior to Python 3.7, the low-level asyncio.ensure_future() function can be used instead:

async def coro():
    ...

# In Python 3.7+
task = asyncio.create_task(coro())
...

# This works in all Python versions but is less readable
task = asyncio.ensure_future(coro())
...
New in version 3.7.

Changed in version 3.8: Added the name parameter.

Sleeping
coroutine asyncio.sleep(delay, result=None, *, loop=None)
Block for delay seconds.

If result is provided, it is returned to the caller when the coroutine completes.

sleep() always suspends the current task, allowing other tasks to run.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example of coroutine displaying the current date every second for 5 seconds:

import asyncio
import datetime

async def display_date():
    loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
    end_time = loop.time() + 5.0
    while True:
        print(datetime.datetime.now())
        if (loop.time() + 1.0) >= end_time:
            break
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

asyncio.run(display_date())
Running Tasks Concurrently
awaitable asyncio.gather(*aws, loop=None, return_exceptions=False)
Run awaitable objects in the aws sequence concurrently.

If any awaitable in aws is a coroutine, it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

If all awaitables are completed successfully, the result is an aggregate list of returned values. The order of result values corresponds to the order of awaitables in aws.

If return_exceptions is False (default), the first raised exception is immediately propagated to the task that awaits on gather(). Other awaitables in the aws sequence won’t be cancelled and will continue to run.

If return_exceptions is True, exceptions are treated the same as successful results, and aggregated in the result list.

If gather() is cancelled, all submitted awaitables (that have not completed yet) are also cancelled.

If any Task or Future from the aws sequence is cancelled, it is treated as if it raised CancelledError – the gather() call is not cancelled in this case. This is to prevent the cancellation of one submitted Task/Future to cause other Tasks/Futures to be cancelled.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

import asyncio

async def factorial(name, number):
    f = 1
    for i in range(2, number + 1):
        print(f"Task {name}: Compute factorial({i})...")
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        f *= i
    print(f"Task {name}: factorial({number}) = {f}")

async def main():
    # Schedule three calls *concurrently*:
    await asyncio.gather(
        factorial("A", 2),
        factorial("B", 3),
        factorial("C", 4),
    )

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     Task A: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task B: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task C: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task A: factorial(2) = 2
#     Task B: Compute factorial(3)...
#     Task C: Compute factorial(3)...
#     Task B: factorial(3) = 6
#     Task C: Compute factorial(4)...
#     Task C: factorial(4) = 24
Changed in version 3.7: If the gather itself is cancelled, the cancellation is propagated regardless of return_exceptions.

Shielding From Cancellation
awaitable asyncio.shield(aw, *, loop=None)
Protect an awaitable object from being cancelled.

If aw is a coroutine it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

The statement:

res = await shield(something())
is equivalent to:

res = await something()
except that if the coroutine containing it is cancelled, the Task running in something() is not cancelled. From the point of view of something(), the cancellation did not happen. Although its caller is still cancelled, so the “await” expression still raises a CancelledError.

If something() is cancelled by other means (i.e. from within itself) that would also cancel shield().

If it is desired to completely ignore cancellation (not recommended) the shield() function should be combined with a try/except clause, as follows:

try:
    res = await shield(something())
except CancelledError:
    res = None
Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Timeouts
coroutine asyncio.wait_for(aw, timeout, *, loop=None)
Wait for the aw awaitable to complete with a timeout.

If aw is a coroutine it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

timeout can either be None or a float or int number of seconds to wait for. If timeout is None, block until the future completes.

If a timeout occurs, it cancels the task and raises asyncio.TimeoutError.

To avoid the task cancellation, wrap it in shield().

The function will wait until the future is actually cancelled, so the total wait time may exceed the timeout.

If the wait is cancelled, the future aw is also cancelled.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

async def eternity():
    # Sleep for one hour
    await asyncio.sleep(3600)
    print('yay!')

async def main():
    # Wait for at most 1 second
    try:
        await asyncio.wait_for(eternity(), timeout=1.0)
    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        print('timeout!')

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     timeout!
Changed in version 3.7: When aw is cancelled due to a timeout, wait_for waits for aw to be cancelled. Previously, it raised asyncio.TimeoutError immediately.

Waiting Primitives
coroutine asyncio.wait(aws, *, loop=None, timeout=None, return_when=ALL_COMPLETED)
Run awaitable objects in the aws set concurrently and block until the condition specified by return_when.

Returns two sets of Tasks/Futures: (done, pending).

Usage:

done, pending = await asyncio.wait(aws)
timeout (a float or int), if specified, can be used to control the maximum number of seconds to wait before returning.

Note that this function does not raise asyncio.TimeoutError. Futures or Tasks that aren’t done when the timeout occurs are simply returned in the second set.

return_when indicates when this function should return. It must be one of the following constants:

Constant

Description

FIRST_COMPLETED

The function will return when any future finishes or is cancelled.

FIRST_EXCEPTION

The function will return when any future finishes by raising an exception. If no future raises an exception then it is equivalent to ALL_COMPLETED.

ALL_COMPLETED

The function will return when all futures finish or are cancelled.

Unlike wait_for(), wait() does not cancel the futures when a timeout occurs.

Deprecated since version 3.8: If any awaitable in aws is a coroutine, it is automatically scheduled as a Task. Passing coroutines objects to wait() directly is deprecated as it leads to confusing behavior.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Note wait() schedules coroutines as Tasks automatically and later returns those implicitly created Task objects in (done, pending) sets. Therefore the following code won’t work as expected:
async def foo():
    return 42

coro = foo()
done, pending = await asyncio.wait({coro})

if coro in done:
    # This branch will never be run!
Here is how the above snippet can be fixed:

async def foo():
    return 42

task = asyncio.create_task(foo())
done, pending = await asyncio.wait({task})

if task in done:
    # Everything will work as expected now.
Deprecated since version 3.8: Passing coroutine objects to wait() directly is deprecated.

asyncio.as_completed(aws, *, loop=None, timeout=None)
Run awaitable objects in the aws set concurrently. Return an iterator of Future objects. Each Future object returned represents the earliest result from the set of the remaining awaitables.

Raises asyncio.TimeoutError if the timeout occurs before all Futures are done.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

for f in as_completed(aws):
    earliest_result = await f
    # ...
Scheduling From Other Threads
asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro, loop)
Submit a coroutine to the given event loop. Thread-safe.

Return a concurrent.futures.Future to wait for the result from another OS thread.

This function is meant to be called from a different OS thread than the one where the event loop is running. Example:

# Create a coroutine
coro = asyncio.sleep(1, result=3)

# Submit the coroutine to a given loop
future = asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro, loop)

# Wait for the result with an optional timeout argument
assert future.result(timeout) == 3
If an exception is raised in the coroutine, the returned Future will be notified. It can also be used to cancel the task in the event loop:

try:
    result = future.result(timeout)
except asyncio.TimeoutError:
    print('The coroutine took too long, cancelling the task...')
    future.cancel()
except Exception as exc:
    print(f'The coroutine raised an exception: {exc!r}')
else:
    print(f'The coroutine returned: {result!r}')
See the concurrency and multithreading section of the documentation.

Unlike other asyncio functions this function requires the loop argument to be passed explicitly.

New in version 3.5.1.

Introspection
asyncio.current_task(loop=None)
Return the currently running Task instance, or None if no task is running.

If loop is None get_running_loop() is used to get the current loop.

New in version 3.7.

asyncio.all_tasks(loop=None)
Return a set of not yet finished Task objects run by the loop.

If loop is None, get_running_loop() is used for getting current loop.

New in version 3.7.

Task Object
class asyncio.Task(coro, *, loop=None, name=None)
A Future-like object that runs a Python coroutine. Not thread-safe.

Tasks are used to run coroutines in event loops. If a coroutine awaits on a Future, the Task suspends the execution of the coroutine and waits for the completion of the Future. When the Future is done, the execution of the wrapped coroutine resumes.

Event loops use cooperative scheduling: an event loop runs one Task at a time. While a Task awaits for the completion of a Future, the event loop runs other Tasks, callbacks, or performs IO operations.

Use the high-level asyncio.create_task() function to create Tasks, or the low-level loop.create_task() or ensure_future() functions. Manual instantiation of Tasks is discouraged.

To cancel a running Task use the cancel() method. Calling it will cause the Task to throw a CancelledError exception into the wrapped coroutine. If a coroutine is awaiting on a Future object during cancellation, the Future object will be cancelled.

cancelled() can be used to check if the Task was cancelled. The method returns True if the wrapped coroutine did not suppress the CancelledError exception and was actually cancelled.

asyncio.Task inherits from Future all of its APIs except Future.set_result() and Future.set_exception().

Tasks support the contextvars module. When a Task is created it copies the current context and later runs its coroutine in the copied context.

Changed in version 3.7: Added support for the contextvars module.

Changed in version 3.8: Added the name parameter.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

cancel()
Request the Task to be cancelled.

This arranges for a CancelledError exception to be thrown into the wrapped coroutine on the next cycle of the event loop.

The coroutine then has a chance to clean up or even deny the request by suppressing the exception with a try … … except CancelledError … finally block. Therefore, unlike Future.cancel(), Task.cancel() does not guarantee that the Task will be cancelled, although suppressing cancellation completely is not common and is actively discouraged.

The following example illustrates how coroutines can intercept the cancellation request:

async def cancel_me():
    print('cancel_me(): before sleep')

    try:
        # Wait for 1 hour
        await asyncio.sleep(3600)
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print('cancel_me(): cancel sleep')
        raise
    finally:
        print('cancel_me(): after sleep')

async def main():
    # Create a "cancel_me" Task
    task = asyncio.create_task(cancel_me())

    # Wait for 1 second
    await asyncio.sleep(1)

    task.cancel()
    try:
        await task
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print("main(): cancel_me is cancelled now")

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     cancel_me(): before sleep
#     cancel_me(): cancel sleep
#     cancel_me(): after sleep
#     main(): cancel_me is cancelled now
cancelled()
Return True if the Task is cancelled.

The Task is cancelled when the cancellation was requested with cancel() and the wrapped coroutine propagated the CancelledError exception thrown into it.

done()
Return True if the Task is done.

A Task is done when the wrapped coroutine either returned a value, raised an exception, or the Task was cancelled.

result()
Return the result of the Task.

If the Task is done, the result of the wrapped coroutine is returned (or if the coroutine raised an exception, that exception is re-raised.)

If the Task has been cancelled, this method raises a CancelledError exception.

If the Task’s result isn’t yet available, this method raises a InvalidStateError exception.

exception()
Return the exception of the Task.

If the wrapped coroutine raised an exception that exception is returned. If the wrapped coroutine returned normally this method returns None.

If the Task has been cancelled, this method raises a CancelledError exception.

If the Task isn’t done yet, this method raises an InvalidStateError exception.

add_done_callback(callback, *, context=None)
Add a callback to be run when the Task is done.

This method should only be used in low-level callback-based code.

See the documentation of Future.add_done_callback() for more details.

remove_done_callback(callback)
Remove callback from the callbacks list.

This method should only be used in low-level callback-based code.

See the documentation of Future.remove_done_callback() for more details.

get_stack(*, limit=None)
Return the list of stack frames for this Task.

If the wrapped coroutine is not done, this returns the stack where it is suspended. If the coroutine has completed successfully or was cancelled, this returns an empty list. If the coroutine was terminated by an exception, this returns the list of traceback frames.

The frames are always ordered from oldest to newest.

Only one stack frame is returned for a suspended coroutine.

The optional limit argument sets the maximum number of frames to return; by default all available frames are returned. The ordering of the returned list differs depending on whether a stack or a traceback is returned: the newest frames of a stack are returned, but the oldest frames of a traceback are returned. (This matches the behavior of the traceback module.)

print_stack(*, limit=None, file=None)
Print the stack or traceback for this Task.

This produces output similar to that of the traceback module for the frames retrieved by get_stack().

The limit argument is passed to get_stack() directly.

The file argument is an I/O stream to which the output is written; by default output is written to sys.stderr.

get_coro()
Return the coroutine object wrapped by the Task.

New in version 3.8.

get_name()
Return the name of the Task.

If no name has been explicitly assigned to the Task, the default asyncio Task implementation generates a default name during instantiation.

New in version 3.8.

set_name(value)
Set the name of the Task.

The value argument can be any object, which is then converted to a string.

In the default Task implementation, the name will be visible in the repr() output of a task object.

New in version 3.8.

classmethod all_tasks(loop=None)
Return a set of all tasks for an event loop.

By default all tasks for the current event loop are returned. If loop is None, the get_event_loop() function is used to get the current loop.

Deprecated since version 3.7, will be removed in version 3.9: Do not call this as a task method. Use the asyncio.all_tasks() function instead.

classmethod current_task(loop=None)
Return the currently running task or None.

If loop is None, the get_event_loop() function is used to get the current loop.

Deprecated since version 3.7, will be removed in version 3.9: Do not call this as a task method. Use the asyncio.current_task() function instead.

Generator-based Coroutines
Note Support for generator-based coroutines is deprecated and is scheduled for removal in Python 3.10.
Generator-based coroutines predate async/await syntax. They are Python generators that use yield from expressions to await on Futures and other coroutines.

Generator-based coroutines should be decorated with @asyncio.coroutine, although this is not enforced.

@asyncio.coroutine
Decorator to mark generator-based coroutines.

This decorator enables legacy generator-based coroutines to be compatible with async/await code:

@asyncio.coroutine
def old_style_coroutine():
    yield from asyncio.sleep(1)

async def main():
    await old_style_coroutine()
This decorator should not be used for async def coroutines.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: Use async def instead.

asyncio.iscoroutine(obj)
Return True if obj is a coroutine object.

This method is different from inspect.iscoroutine() because it returns True for generator-based coroutines.

asyncio.iscoroutinefunction(func)
Return True if func is a coroutine function.

This method is different from inspect.iscoroutinefunction() because it returns True for generator-based coroutine functions decorated with @coroutine.

Three more challenges you may encounter include:

Scheduling—A distributed system has to decide which jobs need to run, when they should run, and where they should run. Schedulers ultimately have limitations, leading to underutilized hardware and unpredictable runtimes.
Latency—The more widely your system is distributed, the more latency you can experience with communications. This often leads to teams making tradeoffs between availability, consistency, and latency.
Observability—Gathering, processing, presenting, and monitoring hardware usage metrics for large clusters is a significant challenge.
How a Distributed System Works
Hardware and software architectures are used to maintain a distributed system. Everything must be interconnected—CPUs via the network and processes via the communication system.

Producer Mel Gibson will not be using paid advertisements to promote The Passion of the Christ to voters in next year's Academy Awards.

Gibson and his Icon Productions partner Bruce Davey said they would not be campaigning in print, radio or TV for success at the Oscars in February. "This film should be judged on its artistic merit, not who spends more money on advertising," Davey said. But DVDs will be sent to Oscar voters, who will be invited to screenings. Icon spent very little on advertising the film, which deals with the last hours of Jesus Christ's life, when it was released earlier this year - instead, it made the film available for special screenings at churches. It went on to gross over $600m (£322m) in ticket sales worldwide. Over recent years, marketing films to the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has become a multi-million dollar industry. Last year, the academy formed a committee to tighten the rules after the campaigns spilled over into personal attacks between studios. Academy president Frank Pierson praised Gibson's move for working to restore the Oscars as a "celebration and appreciation of excellence," and resisting the "crass commercialisation that was threatening the integrity of the award".

No UK premiere for Rings musical

The producers behind the Lord of the Rings musical have abandoned plans to premiere the show in London because no suitable theatre was available.

The £11.5m show will make its debut in Toronto in March 2006, after it was found that all three West End theatres with sufficient capacity were booked. The musical is not expected in London before December 2006. Producer Kevin Wallace said it would be "worth waiting for". "It will be like nothing they have ever seen before." "I know there will be a lot of disappointed British Tolkien fans who hoped to see the show in London, but we couldn't get a London theatre in time," added the British producer. The world premiere of the stage musical, co-produced by Canadian theatrical impresarios David and Ed Mirvish, will take place at Toronto's Princess of Wales Theatre next year.

"Toronto really wanted this premiere. The Tolkien books and films are hugely popular in Canada," said Mr Wallace, shortly after signing the deal in Canada. "We hope the anticipation and excitement over here will create an even bigger buzz by the time we open in London." Auditions begin in Canada on Thursday, but up to five British actors may join the cast, under a deal struck with Canadian Actors' Equity. The music for the show is being written by Bollywood composer AR Rahman, who was behind Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End musical Bollywood Dreams, and in conjuction with the Finnish group Varttina.

"There will be no singing and dancing Hobbits. The music will be in a very traditional mould and draw on ethnic traditions," assured Mr Wallace. The musical's British director is Matthew Warchus, best known for staging the worldwide stage hit Art. "The production will be a hybrid of text, physical theatre, music and spectacle never previously seen on this scale," he said. "Only in the theatre are we actually plunged into the events as they happen. The environment surrounds us and we are in Middle Earth." New Zealander Peter Jackson took 10 years to bring JRR Tolkien's fantasy trilogy to the big screen, winning Academy Awards for best film and best director for the final film The Return of the King in 2004.

The musical's British director is Matthew Warchus, best known for staging the worldwide stage hit Art. "The production will be a hybrid of text, physical theatre, music and spectacle never previously seen on this scale," he said. "Only in the theatre are we actually plunged into the events as they happen. The environment surrounds us and we are in Middle Earth."

No ads for Passion Oscar campaign

Producer Mel Gibson will not be using paid advertisements to promote The Passion of the Christ to voters in next year's Academy Awards.

Gibson and his Icon Productions partner Bruce Davey said they would not be campaigning in print, radio or TV for success at the Oscars in February. "This film should be judged on its artistic merit, not who spends more money on advertising," Davey said. But DVDs will be sent to Oscar voters, who will be invited to screenings. Icon spent very little on advertising the film, which deals with the last hours of Jesus Christ's life, when it was released earlier this year - instead, it made the film available for special screenings at churches. It went on to gross over $600m (£322m) in ticket sales worldwide. Over recent years, marketing films to the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has become a multi-million dollar industry. Last year, the academy formed a committee to tighten the rules after the campaigns spilled over into personal attacks between studios. Academy president Frank Pierson praised Gibson's move for working to restore the Oscars as a "celebration and appreciation of excellence," and resisting the "crass commercialisation that was threatening the integrity of the award".

No UK premiere for Rings musical

The producers behind the Lord of the Rings musical have abandoned plans to premiere the show in London because no suitable theatre was available.

The £11.5m show will make its debut in Toronto in March 2006, after it was found that all three West End theatres with sufficient capacity were booked. The musical is not expected in London before December 2006. Producer Kevin Wallace said it would be "worth waiting for". "It will be like nothing they have ever seen before." "I know there will be a lot of disappointed British Tolkien fans who hoped to see the show in London, but we couldn't get a London theatre in time," added the British producer. The world premiere of the stage musical, co-produced by Canadian theatrical impresarios David and Ed Mirvish, will take place at Toronto's Princess of Wales Theatre next year.

"Toronto really wanted this premiere. The Tolkien books and films are hugely popular in Canada," said Mr Wallace, shortly after signing the deal in Canada. "We hope the anticipation and excitement over here will create an even bigger buzz by the time we open in London." Auditions begin in Canada on Thursday, but up to five British actors may join the cast, under a deal struck with Canadian Actors' Equity. The music for the show is being written by Bollywood composer AR Rahman, who was behind Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End musical Bollywood Dreams, and in conjuction with the Finnish group Varttina.

"There will be no singing and dancing Hobbits. The music will be in a very traditional mould and draw on ethnic traditions," assured Mr Wallace.

"There will be no singing and dancing Hobbits. The music will be in a very traditional mould and draw on ethnic traditions," assured Mr Wallace. The musical's British director is Matthew Warchus, best known for staging the worldwide stage hit Art. "The production will be a hybrid of text, physical theatre, music and spectacle never previously seen on this scale," he said. "Only in the theatre are we actually plunged into the events as they happen. The environment surrounds us and we are in Middle Earth." New Zealander Peter Jackson took 10 years to bring JRR Tolkien's fantasy trilogy to the big screen, winning Academy Awards for best film and best director for the final film The Return of the King in 2004.
No ads for Passion Oscar campaign

Producer Mel Gibson will not be using paid advertisements to promote The Passion of the Christ to voters in next year's Academy Awards.

Gibson and his Icon Productions partner Bruce Davey said they would not be campaigning in print, radio or TV for success at the Oscars in February. "This film should be judged on its artistic merit, not who spends more money on advertising," Davey said. But DVDs will be sent to Oscar voters, who will be invited to screenings.

No UK premiere for Rings musical

The producers behind the Lord of the Rings musical have abandoned plans to premiere the show in London because no suitable theatre was available.

The £11.5m show will make its debut in Toronto in March 2006, after it was found that all three West End theatres with sufficient capacity were booked. The musical is not expected in London before December 2006. Producer Kevin Wallace said it would be "worth waiting for". "It will be like nothing they have ever seen before." "I know there will be a lot of disappointed British Tolkien fans who hoped to see the show in London, but we couldn't get a London theatre in time," added the British producer. The world premiere of the stage musical, co-produced by Canadian theatrical impresarios David and Ed Mirvish, will take place at Toronto's Princess of Wales Theatre next year.

"Toronto really wanted this premiere. The Tolkien books and films are hugely popular in Canada," said Mr Wallace, shortly after signing the deal in Canada. "We hope the anticipation and excitement over here will create an even bigger buzz by the time we open in London." Auditions begin in Canada on Thursday, but up to five British actors may join the cast, under a deal struck with Canadian Actors' Equity. The music for the show is being written by Bollywood composer AR Rahman, who was behind Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End musical Bollywood Dreams, and in conjuction with the Finnish group Varttina.

"There will be no singing and dancing Hobbits. The music will be in a very traditional mould and draw on ethnic traditions," assured Mr Wallace. The musical's British director is Matthew Warchus, best known for staging the worldwide stage hit Art. "The production will be a hybrid of text, physical theatre, music and spectacle never previously seen on this scale," he said. "Only in the theatre are we actually plunged into the events as they happen. The environment surrounds us and we are in Middle Earth." New Zealander Peter Jackson took 10 years to bring JRR Tolkien's fantasy trilogy to the big screen, winning Academy Awards for best film and best director for the final film The Return of the King in 2004.
No ads for Passion Oscar campaign

Producer Mel Gibson will not be using paid advertisements to promote The Passion of the Christ to voters in next year's Academy Awards.

Gibson and his Icon Productions partner Bruce Davey said they would not be campaigning in print, radio or TV for success at the Oscars in February. "This film should be judged on its artistic merit, not who spends more money on advertising," Davey said. But DVDs will be sent to Oscar voters, who will be invited to screenings. Icon spent very little on advertising the film, which deals with the last hours of Jesus Christ's life, when it was released earlier this year - instead, it made the film available for special screenings at churches. It went on to gross over $600m (£322m) in ticket sales worldwide. Over recent years, marketing films to the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has become a multi-million dollar industry.

The asyncio.run() function to run the top-level entry point “main()” function (see the above example.)

Awaiting on a coroutine. The following snippet of code will print “hello” after waiting for 1 second, and then print “world” after waiting for another 2 seconds:

import asyncio
import time

async def say_after(delay, what):
    await asyncio.sleep(delay)
    print(what)

async def main():
    print(f"started at {time.strftime('%X')}")

    await say_after(1, 'hello')
    await say_after(2, 'world')

    print(f"finished at {time.strftime('%X')}")

asyncio.run(main())
Expected output:

started at 17:13:52
hello
world
finished at 17:13:55
The asyncio.create_task() function to run coroutines concurrently as asyncio Tasks.

Let’s modify the above example and run two say_after coroutines concurrently:

async def main():
    task1 = asyncio.create_task(
        say_after(1, 'hello'))

    task2 = asyncio.create_task(
        say_after(2, 'world'))

    print(f"started at {time.strftime('%X')}")

    # Wait until both tasks are completed (should take
    # around 2 seconds.)
    await task1
    await task2

    print(f"finished at {time.strftime('%X')}")
Note that expected output now shows that the snippet runs 1 second faster than before:

started at 17:14:32
hello
world
finished at 17:14:34
Awaitables
We say that an object is an awaitable object if it can be used in an await expression. Many asyncio APIs are designed to accept awaitables.

There are three main types of awaitable objects: coroutines, Tasks, and Futures.

Coroutines

Python coroutines are awaitables and therefore can be awaited from other coroutines:

import asyncio

async def nested():
    return 42

async def main():
    # Nothing happens if we just call "nested()".
    # A coroutine object is created but not awaited,
    # so it *won't run at all*.
    nested()

    # Let's do it differently now and await it:
    print(await nested())  # will print "42".

asyncio.run(main())
Important In this documentation the term “coroutine” can be used for two closely related concepts:
a coroutine function: an async def function;

a coroutine object: an object returned by calling a coroutine function.

asyncio also supports legacy generator-based coroutines.

Tasks

Tasks are used to schedule coroutines concurrently.

When a coroutine is wrapped into a Task with functions like asyncio.create_task() the coroutine is automatically scheduled to run soon:

import asyncio

async def nested():
    return 42

async def main():
    # Schedule nested() to run soon concurrently
    # with "main()".
    task = asyncio.create_task(nested())

    # "task" can now be used to cancel "nested()", or
    # can simply be awaited to wait until it is complete:
    await task

asyncio.run(main())
Futures

A Future is a special low-level awaitable object that represents an eventual result of an asynchronous operation.

When a Future object is awaited it means that the coroutine will wait until the Future is resolved in some other place.

Future objects in asyncio are needed to allow callback-based code to be used with async/await.

Normally there is no need to create Future objects at the application level code.

Future objects, sometimes exposed by libraries and some asyncio APIs, can be awaited:

async def main():
    await function_that_returns_a_future_object()

    # this is also valid:
    await asyncio.gather(
        function_that_returns_a_future_object(),
        some_python_coroutine()
    )
A good example of a low-level function that returns a Future object is loop.run_in_executor().

Running an asyncio Program
asyncio.run(coro, *, debug=False)
Execute the coroutine coro and return the result.

This function runs the passed coroutine, taking care of managing the asyncio event loop and finalizing asynchronous generators.

This function cannot be called when another asyncio event loop is running in the same thread.

If debug is True, the event loop will be run in debug mode.

This function always creates a new event loop and closes it at the end. It should be used as a main entry point for asyncio programs, and should ideally only be called once.

Example:

async def main():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print('hello')

asyncio.run(main())
New in version 3.7.

Note The source code for asyncio.run() can be found in Lib/asyncio/runners.py.
Creating Tasks
asyncio.create_task(coro, *, name=None)
Wrap the coro coroutine into a Task and schedule its execution. Return the Task object.

If name is not None, it is set as the name of the task using Task.set_name().

The task is executed in the loop returned by get_running_loop(), RuntimeError is raised if there is no running loop in current thread.

This function has been added in Python 3.7. Prior to Python 3.7, the low-level asyncio.ensure_future() function can be used instead:

async def coro():
    ...

# In Python 3.7+
task = asyncio.create_task(coro())
...

# This works in all Python versions but is less readable
task = asyncio.ensure_future(coro())
...
New in version 3.7.

Changed in version 3.8: Added the name parameter.

Sleeping
coroutine asyncio.sleep(delay, result=None, *, loop=None)
Block for delay seconds.

If result is provided, it is returned to the caller when the coroutine completes.

sleep() always suspends the current task, allowing other tasks to run.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example of coroutine displaying the current date every second for 5 seconds:

import asyncio
import datetime

async def display_date():
    loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
    end_time = loop.time() + 5.0
    while True:
        print(datetime.datetime.now())
        if (loop.time() + 1.0) >= end_time:
            break
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

asyncio.run(display_date())
Running Tasks Concurrently
awaitable asyncio.gather(*aws, loop=None, return_exceptions=False)
Run awaitable objects in the aws sequence concurrently.

If any awaitable in aws is a coroutine, it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

If all awaitables are completed successfully, the result is an aggregate list of returned values. The order of result values corresponds to the order of awaitables in aws.

If return_exceptions is False (default), the first raised exception is immediately propagated to the task that awaits on gather(). Other awaitables in the aws sequence won’t be cancelled and will continue to run.

If return_exceptions is True, exceptions are treated the same as successful results, and aggregated in the result list.

If gather() is cancelled, all submitted awaitables (that have not completed yet) are also cancelled.

If any Task or Future from the aws sequence is cancelled, it is treated as if it raised CancelledError – the gather() call is not cancelled in this case. This is to prevent the cancellation of one submitted Task/Future to cause other Tasks/Futures to be cancelled.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

import asyncio

async def factorial(name, number):
    f = 1
    for i in range(2, number + 1):
        print(f"Task {name}: Compute factorial({i})...")
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        f *= i
    print(f"Task {name}: factorial({number}) = {f}")

async def main():
    # Schedule three calls *concurrently*:
    await asyncio.gather(
        factorial("A", 2),
        factorial("B", 3),
        factorial("C", 4),
    )

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     Task A: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task B: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task C: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task A: factorial(2) = 2
#     Task B: Compute factorial(3)...
#     Task C: Compute factorial(3)...
#     Task B: factorial(3) = 6
#     Task C: Compute factorial(4)...
#     Task C: factorial(4) = 24
Changed in version 3.7: If the gather itself is cancelled, the cancellation is propagated regardless of return_exceptions.

Shielding From Cancellation
awaitable asyncio.shield(aw, *, loop=None)
Protect an awaitable object from being cancelled.

If aw is a coroutine it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

The statement:

res = await shield(something())
is equivalent to:

res = await something()
except that if the coroutine containing it is cancelled, the Task running in something() is not cancelled. From the point of view of something(), the cancellation did not happen. Although its caller is still cancelled, so the “await” expression still raises a CancelledError.

If something() is cancelled by other means (i.e. from within itself) that would also cancel shield().

If it is desired to completely ignore cancellation (not recommended) the shield() function should be combined with a try/except clause, as follows:

try:
    res = await shield(something())
except CancelledError:
    res = None
Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Timeouts
coroutine asyncio.wait_for(aw, timeout, *, loop=None)
Wait for the aw awaitable to complete with a timeout.

If aw is a coroutine it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

timeout can either be None or a float or int number of seconds to wait for. If timeout is None, block until the future completes.

If a timeout occurs, it cancels the task and raises asyncio.TimeoutError.

To avoid the task cancellation, wrap it in shield().

The function will wait until the future is actually cancelled, so the total wait time may exceed the timeout.

If the wait is cancelled, the future aw is also cancelled.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

async def eternity():
    # Sleep for one hour
    await asyncio.sleep(3600)
    print('yay!')

async def main():
    # Wait for at most 1 second
    try:
        await asyncio.wait_for(eternity(), timeout=1.0)
    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        print('timeout!')

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     timeout!
Changed in version 3.7: When aw is cancelled due to a timeout, wait_for waits for aw to be cancelled. Previously, it raised asyncio.TimeoutError immediately.

Waiting Primitives
coroutine asyncio.wait(aws, *, loop=None, timeout=None, return_when=ALL_COMPLETED)
Run awaitable objects in the aws set concurrently and block until the condition specified by return_when.

Returns two sets of Tasks/Futures: (done, pending).

Usage:

done, pending = await asyncio.wait(aws)
timeout (a float or int), if specified, can be used to control the maximum number of seconds to wait before returning.

Note that this function does not raise asyncio.TimeoutError. Futures or Tasks that aren’t done when the timeout occurs are simply returned in the second set.

return_when indicates when this function should return. It must be one of the following constants:

Constant

Description

FIRST_COMPLETED

The function will return when any future finishes or is cancelled.

FIRST_EXCEPTION

The function will return when any future finishes by raising an exception. If no future raises an exception then it is equivalent to ALL_COMPLETED.

ALL_COMPLETED

The function will return when all futures finish or are cancelled.

Unlike wait_for(), wait() does not cancel the futures when a timeout occurs.

Deprecated since version 3.8: If any awaitable in aws is a coroutine, it is automatically scheduled as a Task. Passing coroutines objects to wait() directly is deprecated as it leads to confusing behavior.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Note wait() schedules coroutines as Tasks automatically and later returns those implicitly created Task objects in (done, pending) sets. Therefore the following code won’t work as expected:
async def foo():
    return 42

coro = foo()
done, pending = await asyncio.wait({coro})

if coro in done:
    # This branch will never be run!
Here is how the above snippet can be fixed:

async def foo():
    return 42

task = asyncio.create_task(foo())
done, pending = await asyncio.wait({task})

if task in done:
    # Everything will work as expected now.
Deprecated since version 3.8: Passing coroutine objects to wait() directly is deprecated.

asyncio.as_completed(aws, *, loop=None, timeout=None)
Run awaitable objects in the aws set concurrently. Return an iterator of Future objects. Each Future object returned represents the earliest result from the set of the remaining awaitables.

Raises asyncio.TimeoutError if the timeout occurs before all Futures are done.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

for f in as_completed(aws):
    earliest_result = await f
    # ...
Scheduling From Other Threads
asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro, loop)
Submit a coroutine to the given event loop. Thread-safe.

Return a concurrent.futures.Future to wait for the result from another OS thread.

This function is meant to be called from a different OS thread than the one where the event loop is running. Example:

# Create a coroutine
coro = asyncio.sleep(1, result=3)

# Submit the coroutine to a given loop
future = asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro, loop)

# Wait for the result with an optional timeout argument
assert future.result(timeout) == 3
If an exception is raised in the coroutine, the returned Future will be notified. It can also be used to cancel the task in the event loop:

try:
    result = future.result(timeout)
except asyncio.TimeoutError:
    print('The coroutine took too long, cancelling the task...')
    future.cancel()
except Exception as exc:
    print(f'The coroutine raised an exception: {exc!r}')
else:
    print(f'The coroutine returned: {result!r}')
See the concurrency and multithreading section of the documentation.

Unlike other asyncio functions this function requires the loop argument to be passed explicitly.

New in version 3.5.1.

Introspection
asyncio.current_task(loop=None)
Return the currently running Task instance, or None if no task is running.

If loop is None get_running_loop() is used to get the current loop.

New in version 3.7.

asyncio.all_tasks(loop=None)
Return a set of not yet finished Task objects run by the loop.

If loop is None, get_running_loop() is used for getting current loop.

New in version 3.7.

Task Object
class asyncio.Task(coro, *, loop=None, name=None)
A Future-like object that runs a Python coroutine. Not thread-safe.

Tasks are used to run coroutines in event loops. If a coroutine awaits on a Future, the Task suspends the execution of the coroutine and waits for the completion of the Future. When the Future is done, the execution of the wrapped coroutine resumes.

Event loops use cooperative scheduling: an event loop runs one Task at a time. While a Task awaits for the completion of a Future, the event loop runs other Tasks, callbacks, or performs IO operations.

Use the high-level asyncio.create_task() function to create Tasks, or the low-level loop.create_task() or ensure_future() functions. Manual instantiation of Tasks is discouraged.

To cancel a running Task use the cancel() method. Calling it will cause the Task to throw a CancelledError exception into the wrapped coroutine. If a coroutine is awaiting on a Future object during cancellation, the Future object will be cancelled.

cancelled() can be used to check if the Task was cancelled. The method returns True if the wrapped coroutine did not suppress the CancelledError exception and was actually cancelled.

asyncio.Task inherits from Future all of its APIs except Future.set_result() and Future.set_exception().

Tasks support the contextvars module. When a Task is created it copies the current context and later runs its coroutine in the copied context.

Changed in version 3.7: Added support for the contextvars module.

Changed in version 3.8: Added the name parameter.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

cancel()
Request the Task to be cancelled.

This arranges for a CancelledError exception to be thrown into the wrapped coroutine on the next cycle of the event loop.

The coroutine then has a chance to clean up or even deny the request by suppressing the exception with a try … … except CancelledError … finally block. Therefore, unlike Future.cancel(), Task.cancel() does not guarantee that the Task will be cancelled, although suppressing cancellation completely is not common and is actively discouraged.

The following example illustrates how coroutines can intercept the cancellation request:

async def cancel_me():
    print('cancel_me(): before sleep')

    try:
        # Wait for 1 hour
        await asyncio.sleep(3600)
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print('cancel_me(): cancel sleep')
        raise
    finally:
        print('cancel_me(): after sleep')

async def main():
    # Create a "cancel_me" Task
    task = asyncio.create_task(cancel_me())

    # Wait for 1 second
    await asyncio.sleep(1)

    task.cancel()
    try:
        await task
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print("main(): cancel_me is cancelled now")

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     cancel_me(): before sleep
#     cancel_me(): cancel sleep
#     cancel_me(): after sleep
#     main(): cancel_me is cancelled now
cancelled()
Return True if the Task is cancelled.

The Task is cancelled when the cancellation was requested with cancel() and the wrapped coroutine propagated the CancelledError exception thrown into it.

done()
Return True if the Task is done.

A Task is done when the wrapped coroutine either returned a value, raised an exception, or the Task was cancelled.

result()
Return the result of the Task.

If the Task is done, the result of the wrapped coroutine is returned (or if the coroutine raised an exception, that exception is re-raised.)

If the Task has been cancelled, this method raises a CancelledError exception.

If the Task’s result isn’t yet available, this method raises a InvalidStateError exception.

exception()
Return the exception of the Task.

If the wrapped coroutine raised an exception that exception is returned. If the wrapped coroutine returned normally this method returns None.

If the Task has been cancelled, this method raises a CancelledError exception.

If the Task isn’t done yet, this method raises an InvalidStateError exception.

add_done_callback(callback, *, context=None)
Add a callback to be run when the Task is done.

This method should only be used in low-level callback-based code.

See the documentation of Future.add_done_callback() for more details.

remove_done_callback(callback)
Remove callback from the callbacks list.

This method should only be used in low-level callback-based code.

See the documentation of Future.remove_done_callback() for more details.

get_stack(*, limit=None)
Return the list of stack frames for this Task.

If the wrapped coroutine is not done, this returns the stack where it is suspended. If the coroutine has completed successfully or was cancelled, this returns an empty list. If the coroutine was terminated by an exception, this returns the list of traceback frames.

The frames are always ordered from oldest to newest.

Only one stack frame is returned for a suspended coroutine.

The optional limit argument sets the maximum number of frames to return; by default all available frames are returned. The ordering of the returned list differs depending on whether a stack or a traceback is returned: the newest frames of a stack are returned, but the oldest frames of a traceback are returned. (This matches the behavior of the traceback module.)

print_stack(*, limit=None, file=None)
Print the stack or traceback for this Task.

This produces output similar to that of the traceback module for the frames retrieved by get_stack().

The limit argument is passed to get_stack() directly.

The file argument is an I/O stream to which the output is written; by default output is written to sys.stderr.

get_coro()
Return the coroutine object wrapped by the Task.

New in version 3.8.

get_name()
Return the name of the Task.

If no name has been explicitly assigned to the Task, the default asyncio Task implementation generates a default name during instantiation.

New in version 3.8.

set_name(value)
Set the name of the Task.

The value argument can be any object, which is then converted to a string.

In the default Task implementation, the name will be visible in the repr() output of a task object.

New in version 3.8.

classmethod all_tasks(loop=None)
Return a set of all tasks for an event loop.

By default all tasks for the current event loop are returned. If loop is None, the get_event_loop() function is used to get the current loop.

Deprecated since version 3.7, will be removed in version 3.9: Do not call this as a task method. Use the asyncio.all_tasks() function instead.

classmethod current_task(loop=None)
Return the currently running task or None.

If loop is None, the get_event_loop() function is used to get the current loop.

Deprecated since version 3.7, will be removed in version 3.9: Do not call this as a task method. Use the asyncio.current_task() function instead.

Generator-based Coroutines
Note Support for generator-based coroutines is deprecated and is scheduled for removal in Python 3.10.
Generator-based coroutines predate async/await syntax. They are Python generators that use yield from expressions to await on Futures and other coroutines.

Generator-based coroutines should be decorated with @asyncio.coroutine, although this is not enforced.

@asyncio.coroutine
Decorator to mark generator-based coroutines.

This decorator enables legacy generator-based coroutines to be compatible with async/await code:

@asyncio.coroutine
def old_style_coroutine():
    yield from asyncio.sleep(1)

async def main():
    await old_style_coroutine()
This decorator should not be used for async def coroutines.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: Use async def instead.

asyncio.iscoroutine(obj)
Return True if obj is a coroutine object.

This method is different from inspect.iscoroutine() because it returns True for generator-based coroutines.

asyncio.iscoroutinefunction(func)
Return True if func is a coroutine function.

This method is different from inspect.iscoroutinefunction() because it returns True for generator-based coroutine functions decorated with @coroutine.

No UK premiere for Rings musical

The producers behind the Lord of the Rings musical have abandoned plans to premiere the show in London because no suitable theatre was available.

The £11.5m show will make its debut in Toronto in March 2006, after it was found that all three West End theatres with sufficient capacity were booked. The musical is not expected in London before December 2006. Producer Kevin Wallace said it would be "worth waiting for". "It will be like nothing they have ever seen before." "I know there will be a lot of disappointed British Tolkien fans who hoped to see the show in London, but we couldn't get a London theatre in time," added the British producer. The world premiere of the stage musical, co-produced by Canadian theatrical impresarios David and Ed Mirvish, will take place at Toronto's Princess of Wales Theatre next year.

"Toronto really wanted this premiere. The Tolkien books and films are hugely popular in Canada," said Mr Wallace, shortly after signing the deal in Canada. "We hope the anticipation and excitement over here will create an even bigger buzz by the time we open in London." Auditions begin in Canada on Thursday, but up to five British actors may join the cast, under a deal struck with Canadian Actors' Equity. The music for the show is being written by Bollywood composer AR Rahman, who was behind Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End musical Bollywood Dreams, and in conjuction with the Finnish group Varttina.

"There will be no singing and dancing Hobbits. The music will be in a very traditional mould and draw on ethnic traditions," assured Mr Wallace. The musical's British director is Matthew Warchus, best known for staging the worldwide stage hit Art. "The production will be a hybrid of text, physical theatre, music and spectacle never previously seen on this scale," he said. "Only in the theatre are we actually plunged into the events as they happen. The environment surrounds us and we are in Middle Earth." New Zealander Peter Jackson took 10 years to bring JRR Tolkien's fantasy trilogy to the big screen, winning Academy Awards for best film and best director for the final film The Return of the King in 2004.
No ads for Passion Oscar campaign

Producer Mel Gibson will not be using paid advertisements to promote The Passion of the Christ to voters in next year's Academy Awards.

Gibson and his Icon Productions partner Bruce Davey said they would not be campaigning in print, radio or TV for success at the Oscars in February. "This film should be judged on its artistic merit, not who spends more money on advertising," Davey said. But DVDs will be sent to Oscar voters, who will be invited to screenings. Icon spent very little on advertising the film, which deals with the last hours of Jesus Christ's life, when it was released earlier this year - instead, it made the film available for special screenings at churches. It went on to gross over $600m (£322m) in ticket sales worldwide. Over recent years, marketing films to the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has become a multi-million dollar industry. Last year, the academy formed a committee to tighten the rules after the campaigns spilled over into personal attacks between studios. Academy president Frank Pierson praised Gibson's move for working to restore the Oscars as a "celebration and appreciation of excellence," and resisting the "crass commercialisation that was threatening the integrity of the award".

No UK premiere for Rings musical

The producers behind the Lord of the Rings musical have abandoned plans to premiere the show in London because no suitable theatre was available.

The £11.5m show will make its debut in Toronto in March 2006, after it was found that all three West End theatres with sufficient capacity were booked. The musical is not expected in London before December 2006. Producer Kevin Wallace said it would be "worth waiting for". "It will be like nothing they have ever seen before." "I know there will be a lot of disappointed British Tolkien fans who hoped to see the show in London, but we couldn't get a London theatre in time," added the British producer. The world premiere of the stage musical, co-produced by Canadian theatrical impresarios David and Ed Mirvish, will take place at Toronto's Princess of Wales Theatre next year.

"Toronto really wanted this premiere. The Tolkien books and films are hugely popular in Canada," said Mr Wallace, shortly after signing the deal in Canada. "We hope the anticipation and excitement over here will create an even bigger buzz by the time we open in London." Auditions begin in Canada on Thursday, but up to five British actors may join the cast, under a deal struck with Canadian Actors' Equity. The music for the show is being written by Bollywood composer AR Rahman, who was behind Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End musical Bollywood Dreams, and in conjuction with the Finnish group Varttina.

"There will be no singing and dancing Hobbits. The music will be in a very traditional mould and draw on ethnic traditions," assured Mr Wallace. The musical's British director is Matthew Warchus, best known for staging the worldwide stage hit Art. "The production will be a hybrid of text, physical theatre, music and spectacle never previously seen on this scale," he said. "Only in the theatre are we actually plunged into the events as they happen. The environment surrounds us and we are in Middle Earth." New Zealander Peter Jackson took 10 years to bring JRR Tolkien's fantasy trilogy to the big screen, winning Academy Awards for best film and best director for the final film The Return of the King in 2004.

A distributed system, also known as distributed computing, is a system with multiple components located on different machines that communicate and coordinate actions in order to appear as a single coherent system to the end-user.

Overview
The machines that are a part of a distributed system may be computers, physical servers, virtual machines, containers, or any other node that can connect to the network, have local memory, and communicate by passing messages.

There are two general ways that distributed systems function:

Each machine works toward a common goal and the end-user views results as one cohesive unit.
Each machine has its own end-user and the distributed system facilitates sharing resources or communication services.
Although distributed systems can sometimes be obscure, they usually have three primary characteristics: all components run concurrently, there is no global clock, and all components fail independently of each other.

Benefits and challenges of distributed systems
There are three reasons that teams generally decide to implement distributed systems:

Horizontal Scalability—Since computing happens independently on each node, it is easy and generally inexpensive to add additional nodes and functionality as necessary.
Reliability—Most distributed systems are fault-tolerant as they can be made up of hundreds of nodes that work together. The system generally doesn’t experience any disruptions if a single machine fails.
Performance—Distributed systems are extremely efficient because work loads can be broken up and sent to multiple machines.
However, distributed systems are not without challenges. Complex architectural design, construction, and debugging processes that are required to create an effective distributed system can be overwhelming.

>> import asyncio

>>> async def main():
...     print('hello')
...     await asyncio.sleep(1)
...     print('world')

>>> asyncio.run(main())
hello
world
Note that simply calling a coroutine will not schedule it to be executed:

>>>
>>> main()
<coroutine object main at 0x1053bb7c8>
To actually run a coroutine, asyncio provides three main mechanisms:

The asyncio.run() function to run the top-level entry point “main()” function (see the above example.)

Awaiting on a coroutine. The following snippet of code will print “hello” after waiting for 1 second, and then print “world” after waiting for another 2 seconds:

import asyncio
import time

async def say_after(delay, what):
    await asyncio.sleep(delay)
    print(what)

async def main():
    print(f"started at {time.strftime('%X')}")

    await say_after(1, 'hello')
    await say_after(2, 'world')

    print(f"finished at {time.strftime('%X')}")

asyncio.run(main())
Expected output:

started at 17:13:52
hello
world
finished at 17:13:55
The asyncio.create_task() function to run coroutines concurrently as asyncio Tasks.

Let’s modify the above example and run two say_after coroutines concurrently:

async def main():
    task1 = asyncio.create_task(
        say_after(1, 'hello'))

    task2 = asyncio.create_task(
        say_after(2, 'world'))

    print(f"started at {time.strftime('%X')}")

    # Wait until both tasks are completed (should take
    # around 2 seconds.)
    await task1
    await task2

    print(f"finished at {time.strftime('%X')}")
Note that expected output now shows that the snippet runs 1 second faster than before:

started at 17:14:32
hello
world
finished at 17:14:34
Awaitables
We say that an object is an awaitable object if it can be used in an await expression. Many asyncio APIs are designed to accept awaitables.

There are three main types of awaitable objects: coroutines, Tasks, and Futures.

Coroutines

Python coroutines are awaitables and therefore can be awaited from other coroutines:

import asyncio

async def nested():
    return 42

async def main():
    # Nothing happens if we just call "nested()".
    # A coroutine object is created but not awaited,
    # so it *won't run at all*.
    nested()

    # Let's do it differently now and await it:
    print(await nested())  # will print "42".

asyncio.run(main())
Important In this documentation the term “coroutine” can be used for two closely related concepts:
a coroutine function: an async def function;

a coroutine object: an object returned by calling a coroutine function.

asyncio also supports legacy generator-based coroutines.

Tasks

Tasks are used to schedule coroutines concurrently.

When a coroutine is wrapped into a Task with functions like asyncio.create_task() the coroutine is automatically scheduled to run soon:

import asyncio

async def nested():
    return 42

async def main():
    # Schedule nested() to run soon concurrently
    # with "main()".
    task = asyncio.create_task(nested())

    # "task" can now be used to cancel "nested()", or
    # can simply be awaited to wait until it is complete:
    await task

asyncio.run(main())
Futures

A Future is a special low-level awaitable object that represents an eventual result of an asynchronous operation.

When a Future object is awaited it means that the coroutine will wait until the Future is resolved in some other place.

Future objects in asyncio are needed to allow callback-based code to be used with async/await.

Normally there is no need to create Future objects at the application level code.

Future objects, sometimes exposed by libraries and some asyncio APIs, can be awaited:

async def main():
    await function_that_returns_a_future_object()

    # this is also valid:
    await asyncio.gather(
        function_that_returns_a_future_object(),
        some_python_coroutine()
    )
A good example of a low-level function that returns a Future object is loop.run_in_executor().

Running an asyncio Program
asyncio.run(coro, *, debug=False)
Execute the coroutine coro and return the result.

This function runs the passed coroutine, taking care of managing the asyncio event loop and finalizing asynchronous generators.

This function cannot be called when another asyncio event loop is running in the same thread.

If debug is True, the event loop will be run in debug mode.

This function always creates a new event loop and closes it at the end. It should be used as a main entry point for asyncio programs, and should ideally only be called once.

Example:

async def main():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print('hello')

asyncio.run(main())
New in version 3.7.

Note The source code for asyncio.run() can be found in Lib/asyncio/runners.py.
Creating Tasks
asyncio.create_task(coro, *, name=None)
Wrap the coro coroutine into a Task and schedule its execution. Return the Task object.

If name is not None, it is set as the name of the task using Task.set_name().

The task is executed in the loop returned by get_running_loop(), RuntimeError is raised if there is no running loop in current thread.

This function has been added in Python 3.7. Prior to Python 3.7, the low-level asyncio.ensure_future() function can be used instead:

async def coro():
    ...

# In Python 3.7+
task = asyncio.create_task(coro())
...

# This works in all Python versions but is less readable
task = asyncio.ensure_future(coro())
...
New in version 3.7.

Changed in version 3.8: Added the name parameter.

Sleeping
coroutine asyncio.sleep(delay, result=None, *, loop=None)
Block for delay seconds.

If result is provided, it is returned to the caller when the coroutine completes.

sleep() always suspends the current task, allowing other tasks to run.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example of coroutine displaying the current date every second for 5 seconds:

import asyncio
import datetime

async def display_date():
    loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
    end_time = loop.time() + 5.0
    while True:
        print(datetime.datetime.now())
        if (loop.time() + 1.0) >= end_time:
            break
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

asyncio.run(display_date())
Running Tasks Concurrently
awaitable asyncio.gather(*aws, loop=None, return_exceptions=False)
Run awaitable objects in the aws sequence concurrently.

If any awaitable in aws is a coroutine, it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

If all awaitables are completed successfully, the result is an aggregate list of returned values. The order of result values corresponds to the order of awaitables in aws.

If return_exceptions is False (default), the first raised exception is immediately propagated to the task that awaits on gather(). Other awaitables in the aws sequence won’t be cancelled and will continue to run.

If return_exceptions is True, exceptions are treated the same as successful results, and aggregated in the result list.

If gather() is cancelled, all submitted awaitables (that have not completed yet) are also cancelled.

If any Task or Future from the aws sequence is cancelled, it is treated as if it raised CancelledError – the gather() call is not cancelled in this case. This is to prevent the cancellation of one submitted Task/Future to cause other Tasks/Futures to be cancelled.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

import asyncio

async def factorial(name, number):
    f = 1
    for i in range(2, number + 1):
        print(f"Task {name}: Compute factorial({i})...")
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        f *= i
    print(f"Task {name}: factorial({number}) = {f}")

async def main():
    # Schedule three calls *concurrently*:
    await asyncio.gather(
        factorial("A", 2),
        factorial("B", 3),
        factorial("C", 4),
    )

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     Task A: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task B: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task C: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task A: factorial(2) = 2
#     Task B: Compute factorial(3)...
#     Task C: Compute factorial(3)...
#     Task B: factorial(3) = 6
#     Task C: Compute factorial(4)...
#     Task C: factorial(4) = 24
Changed in version 3.7: If the gather itself is cancelled, the cancellation is propagated regardless of return_exceptions.

Shielding From Cancellation
awaitable asyncio.shield(aw, *, loop=None)
Protect an awaitable object from being cancelled.

If aw is a coroutine it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

The statement:

res = await shield(something())
is equivalent to:

res = await something()
except that if the coroutine containing it is cancelled, the Task running in something() is not cancelled. From the point of view of something(), the cancellation did not happen. Although its caller is still cancelled, so the “await” expression still raises a CancelledError.

If something() is cancelled by other means (i.e. from within itself) that would also cancel shield().

If it is desired to completely ignore cancellation (not recommended) the shield() function should be combined with a try/except clause, as follows:

try:
    res = await shield(something())
except CancelledError:
    res = None
Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Timeouts
coroutine asyncio.wait_for(aw, timeout, *, loop=None)
Wait for the aw awaitable to complete with a timeout.

If aw is a coroutine it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

timeout can either be None or a float or int number of seconds to wait for. If timeout is None, block until the future completes.

If a timeout occurs, it cancels the task and raises asyncio.TimeoutError.

To avoid the task cancellation, wrap it in shield().

The function will wait until the future is actually cancelled, so the total wait time may exceed the timeout.

If the wait is cancelled, the future aw is also cancelled.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

async def eternity():
    # Sleep for one hour
    await asyncio.sleep(3600)
    print('yay!')

async def main():
    # Wait for at most 1 second
    try:
        await asyncio.wait_for(eternity(), timeout=1.0)
    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        print('timeout!')

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     timeout!
Changed in version 3.7: When aw is cancelled due to a timeout, wait_for waits for aw to be cancelled. Previously, it raised asyncio.TimeoutError immediately.

Waiting Primitives
coroutine asyncio.wait(aws, *, loop=None, timeout=None, return_when=ALL_COMPLETED)
Run awaitable objects in the aws set concurrently and block until the condition specified by return_when.

Returns two sets of Tasks/Futures: (done, pending).

Usage:

done, pending = await asyncio.wait(aws)
timeout (a float or int), if specified, can be used to control the maximum number of seconds to wait before returning.

Note that this function does not raise asyncio.TimeoutError. Futures or Tasks that aren’t done when the timeout occurs are simply returned in the second set.

return_when indicates when this function should return. It must be one of the following constants:

Constant

Description

FIRST_COMPLETED

The function will return when any future finishes or is cancelled.

FIRST_EXCEPTION

The function will return when any future finishes by raising an exception. If no future raises an exception then it is equivalent to ALL_COMPLETED.

ALL_COMPLETED

The function will return when all futures finish or are cancelled.

Unlike wait_for(), wait() does not cancel the futures when a timeout occurs.

Deprecated since version 3.8: If any awaitable in aws is a coroutine, it is automatically scheduled as a Task. Passing coroutines objects to wait() directly is deprecated as it leads to confusing behavior.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Note wait() schedules coroutines as Tasks automatically and later returns those implicitly created Task objects in (done, pending) sets. Therefore the following code won’t work as expected:
async def foo():
    return 42

coro = foo()
done, pending = await asyncio.wait({coro})

if coro in done:
    # This branch will never be run!
Here is how the above snippet can be fixed:

async def foo():
    return 42

task = asyncio.create_task(foo())
done, pending = await asyncio.wait({task})

if task in done:
    # Everything will work as expected now.
Deprecated since version 3.8: Passing coroutine objects to wait() directly is deprecated.

asyncio.as_completed(aws, *, loop=None, timeout=None)
Run awaitable objects in the aws set concurrently. Return an iterator of Future objects. Each Future object returned represents the earliest result from the set of the remaining awaitables.

Raises asyncio.TimeoutError if the timeout occurs before all Futures are done.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

for f in as_completed(aws):
    earliest_result = await f
    # ...
Scheduling From Other Threads
asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro, loop)
Submit a coroutine to the given event loop. Thread-safe.

Return a concurrent.futures.Future to wait for the result from another OS thread.

This function is meant to be called from a different OS thread than the one where the event loop is running. Example:

# Create a coroutine
coro = asyncio.sleep(1, result=3)

# Submit the coroutine to a given loop
future = asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro, loop)

# Wait for the result with an optional timeout argument
assert future.result(timeout) == 3
If an exception is raised in the coroutine, the returned Future will be notified. It can also be used to cancel the task in the event loop:

try:
    result = future.result(timeout)
except asyncio.TimeoutError:
    print('The coroutine took too long, cancelling the task...')
    future.cancel()
except Exception as exc:
    print(f'The coroutine raised an exception: {exc!r}')
else:
    print(f'The coroutine returned: {result!r}')
See the concurrency and multithreading section of the documentation.

Unlike other asyncio functions this function requires the loop argument to be passed explicitly.

New in version 3.5.1.

Introspection
asyncio.current_task(loop=None)
Return the currently running Task instance, or None if no task is running.

If loop is None get_running_loop() is used to get the current loop.

New in version 3.7.

asyncio.all_tasks(loop=None)
Return a set of not yet finished Task objects run by the loop.

If loop is None, get_running_loop() is used for getting current loop.

New in version 3.7.

Task Object
class asyncio.Task(coro, *, loop=None, name=None)
A Future-like object that runs a Python coroutine. Not thread-safe.

Tasks are used to run coroutines in event loops. If a coroutine awaits on a Future, the Task suspends the execution of the coroutine and waits for the completion of the Future. When the Future is done, the execution of the wrapped coroutine resumes.

Event loops use cooperative scheduling: an event loop runs one Task at a time. While a Task awaits for the completion of a Future, the event loop runs other Tasks, callbacks, or performs IO operations.

Use the high-level asyncio.create_task() function to create Tasks, or the low-level loop.create_task() or ensure_future() functions. Manual instantiation of Tasks is discouraged.

To cancel a running Task use the cancel() method. Calling it will cause the Task to throw a CancelledError exception into the wrapped coroutine. If a coroutine is awaiting on a Future object during cancellation, the Future object will be cancelled.

cancelled() can be used to check if the Task was cancelled. The method returns True if the wrapped coroutine did not suppress the CancelledError exception and was actually cancelled.

asyncio.Task inherits from Future all of its APIs except Future.set_result() and Future.set_exception().

Tasks support the contextvars module. When a Task is created it copies the current context and later runs its coroutine in the copied context.

Changed in version 3.7: Added support for the contextvars module.

Changed in version 3.8: Added the name parameter.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

cancel()
Request the Task to be cancelled.

This arranges for a CancelledError exception to be thrown into the wrapped coroutine on the next cycle of the event loop.

The coroutine then has a chance to clean up or even deny the request by suppressing the exception with a try … … except CancelledError … finally block. Therefore, unlike Future.cancel(), Task.cancel() does not guarantee that the Task will be cancelled, although suppressing cancellation completely is not common and is actively discouraged.

The following example illustrates how coroutines can intercept the cancellation request:

async def cancel_me():
    print('cancel_me(): before sleep')

    try:
        # Wait for 1 hour
        await asyncio.sleep(3600)
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print('cancel_me(): cancel sleep')
        raise
    finally:
        print('cancel_me(): after sleep')

async def main():
    # Create a "cancel_me" Task
    task = asyncio.create_task(cancel_me())

    # Wait for 1 second
    await asyncio.sleep(1)

    task.cancel()
    try:
        await task
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print("main(): cancel_me is cancelled now")

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     cancel_me(): before sleep
#     cancel_me(): cancel sleep
#     cancel_me(): after sleep
#     main(): cancel_me is cancelled now
cancelled()
Return True if the Task is cancelled.

The Task is cancelled when the cancellation was requested with cancel() and the wrapped coroutine propagated the CancelledError exception thrown into it.

done()
Return True if the Task is done.

A Task is done when the wrapped coroutine either returned a value, raised an exception, or the Task was cancelled.

result()
Return the result of the Task.

If the Task is done, the result of the wrapped coroutine is returned (or if the coroutine raised an exception, that exception is re-raised.)

If the Task has been cancelled, this method raises a CancelledError exception.

If the Task’s result isn’t yet available, this method raises a InvalidStateError exception.

exception()
Return the exception of the Task.

If the wrapped coroutine raised an exception that exception is returned. If the wrapped coroutine returned normally this method returns None.

If the Task has been cancelled, this method raises a CancelledError exception.

If the Task isn’t done yet, this method raises an InvalidStateError exception.

add_done_callback(callback, *, context=None)
Add a callback to be run when the Task is done.

This method should only be used in low-level callback-based code.

See the documentation of Future.add_done_callback() for more details.

remove_done_callback(callback)
Remove callback from the callbacks list.

This method should only be used in low-level callback-based code.

See the documentation of Future.remove_done_callback() for more details.

get_stack(*, limit=None)
Return the list of stack frames for this Task.

If the wrapped coroutine is not done, this returns the stack where it is suspended. If the coroutine has completed successfully or was cancelled, this returns an empty list. If the coroutine was terminated by an exception, this returns the list of traceback frames.

The frames are always ordered from oldest to newest.

Only one stack frame is returned for a suspended coroutine.

The optional limit argument sets the maximum number of frames to return; by default all available frames are returned. The ordering of the returned list differs depending on whether a stack or a traceback is returned: the newest frames of a stack are returned, but the oldest frames of a traceback are returned. (This matches the behavior of the traceback module.)

print_stack(*, limit=None, file=None)
Print the stack or traceback for this Task.

This produces output similar to that of the traceback module for the frames retrieved by get_stack().

The limit argument is passed to get_stack() directly.

The file argument is an I/O stream to which the output is written; by default output is written to sys.stderr.

get_coro()
Return the coroutine object wrapped by the Task.

New in version 3.8.

get_name()
Return the name of the Task.

If no name has been explicitly assigned to the Task, the default asyncio Task implementation generates a default name during instantiation.

New in version 3.8.

set_name(value)
Set the name of the Task.

The value argument can be any object, which is then converted to a string.

In the default Task implementation, the name will be visible in the repr() output of a task object.

New in version 3.8.

classmethod all_tasks(loop=None)
Return a set of all tasks for an event loop.

By default all tasks for the current event loop are returned. If loop is None, the get_event_loop() function is used to get the current loop.

Deprecated since version 3.7, will be removed in version 3.9: Do not call this as a task method. Use the asyncio.all_tasks() function instead.

classmethod current_task(loop=None)
Return the currently running task or None.

If loop is None, the get_event_loop() function is used to get the current loop.

Deprecated since version 3.7, will be removed in version 3.9: Do not call this as a task method. Use the asyncio.current_task() function instead.

Generator-based Coroutines
Note Support for generator-based coroutines is deprecated and is scheduled for removal in Python 3.10.
Generator-based coroutines predate async/await syntax. They are Python generators that use yield from expressions to await on Futures and other coroutines.

Generator-based coroutines should be decorated with @asyncio.coroutine, although this is not enforced.

@asyncio.coroutine
Decorator to mark generator-based coroutines.

This decorator enables legacy generator-based coroutines to be compatible with async/await code:

@asyncio.coroutine
def old_style_coroutine():
    yield from asyncio.sleep(1)

async def main():
    await old_style_coroutine()
This decorator should not be used for async def coroutines.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: Use async def instead.

asyncio.iscoroutine(obj)
Return True if obj is a coroutine object.

This method is different from inspect.iscoroutine() because it returns True for generator-based coroutines.

asyncio.iscoroutinefunction(func)
Return True if func is a coroutine function.

This method is different from inspect.iscoroutinefunction() because it returns True for generator-based coroutine functions decorated with @coroutine.

Three more challenges you may encounter include:

Scheduling—A distributed system has to decide which jobs need to run, when they should run, and where they should run. Schedulers ultimately have limitations, leading to underutilized hardware and unpredictable runtimes.
Latency—The more widely your system is distributed, the more latency you can experience with communications. This often leads to teams making tradeoffs between availability, consistency, and latency.
Observability—Gathering, processing, presenting, and monitoring hardware usage metrics for large clusters is a significant challenge.
How a Distributed System Works
Hardware and software architectures are used to maintain a distributed system. Everything must be interconnected—CPUs via the network and processes via the communication system.

Producer Mel Gibson will not be using paid advertisements to promote The Passion of the Christ to voters in next year's Academy Awards.

Gibson and his Icon Productions partner Bruce Davey said they would not be campaigning in print, radio or TV for success at the Oscars in February. "This film should be judged on its artistic merit, not who spends more money on advertising," Davey said. But DVDs will be sent to Oscar voters, who will be invited to screenings. Icon spent very little on advertising the film, which deals with the last hours of Jesus Christ's life, when it was released earlier this year - instead, it made the film available for special screenings at churches. It went on to gross over $600m (£322m) in ticket sales worldwide. Over recent years, marketing films to the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has become a multi-million dollar industry. Last year, the academy formed a committee to tighten the rules after the campaigns spilled over into personal attacks between studios. Academy president Frank Pierson praised Gibson's move for working to restore the Oscars as a "celebration and appreciation of excellence," and resisting the "crass commercialisation that was threatening the integrity of the award".

No UK premiere for Rings musical

The producers behind the Lord of the Rings musical have abandoned plans to premiere the show in London because no suitable theatre was available.

The £11.5m show will make its debut in Toronto in March 2006, after it was found that all three West End theatres with sufficient capacity were booked. The musical is not expected in London before December 2006. Producer Kevin Wallace said it would be "worth waiting for". "It will be like nothing they have ever seen before." "I know there will be a lot of disappointed British Tolkien fans who hoped to see the show in London, but we couldn't get a London theatre in time," added the British producer. The world premiere of the stage musical, co-produced by Canadian theatrical impresarios David and Ed Mirvish, will take place at Toronto's Princess of Wales Theatre next year.

"Toronto really wanted this premiere. The Tolkien books and films are hugely popular in Canada," said Mr Wallace, shortly after signing the deal in Canada. "We hope the anticipation and excitement over here will create an even bigger buzz by the time we open in London." Auditions begin in Canada on Thursday, but up to five British actors may join the cast, under a deal struck with Canadian Actors' Equity. The music for the show is being written by Bollywood composer AR Rahman, who was behind Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End musical Bollywood Dreams, and in conjuction with the Finnish group Varttina.

"There will be no singing and dancing Hobbits. The music will be in a very traditional mould and draw on ethnic traditions," assured Mr Wallace. The musical's British director is Matthew Warchus, best known for staging the worldwide stage hit Art. "The production will be a hybrid of text, physical theatre, music and spectacle never previously seen on this scale," he said. "Only in the theatre are we actually plunged into the events as they happen. The environment surrounds us and we are in Middle Earth." New Zealander Peter Jackson took 10 years to bring JRR Tolkien's fantasy trilogy to the big screen, winning Academy Awards for best film and best director for the final film The Return of the King in 2004.

The musical is not expected in London before December 2006. Producer Kevin Wallace said it would be "worth waiting for". "It will be like nothing they have ever seen before." "I know there will be a lot of disappointed British Tolkien fans who hoped to see the show in London, but we couldn't get a London theatre in time," added the British producer. The world premiere of the stage musical, co-produced by Canadian theatrical impresarios David and Ed Mirvish, will take place at Toronto's Princess of Wales Theatre next year.

"Toronto really wanted this premiere. The Tolkien books and films are hugely popular in Canada," said Mr Wallace, shortly after signing the deal in Canada. "We hope the anticipation and excitement over here will create an even bigger buzz by the time we open in London." Auditions begin in Canada on Thursday, but up to five British actors may join the cast, under a deal struck with Canadian Actors' Equity. The music for the show is being written by Bollywood composer AR Rahman, who was behind Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End musical Bollywood Dreams, and in conjuction with the Finnish group Varttina.

"There will be no singing and dancing Hobbits. The music will be in a very traditional mould and draw on ethnic traditions," assured Mr Wallace. The musical's British director is Matthew Warchus, best known for staging the worldwide stage hit Art. "The production will be a hybrid of text, physical theatre, music and spectacle never previously seen on this scale," he said. "Only in the theatre are we actually plunged into the events as they happen. The environment surrounds us and we are in Middle Earth." New Zealander Peter Jackson took 10 years to bring JRR Tolkien's fantasy trilogy to the big screen, winning Academy Awards for best film and best director for the final film The Return of the King in 2004.
No ads for Passion Oscar campaign

Producer Mel Gibson will not be using paid advertisements to promote The Passion of the Christ to voters in next year's Academy Awards.

Gibson and his Icon Productions partner Bruce Davey said they would not be campaigning in print, radio or TV for success at the Oscars in February. "This film should be judged on its artistic merit, not who spends more money on advertising," Davey said. But DVDs will be sent to Oscar voters, who will be invited to screenings. Icon spent very little on advertising the film, which deals with the last hours of Jesus Christ's life, when it was released earlier this year - instead, it made the film available for special screenings at churches. It went on to gross over $600m (£322m) in ticket sales worldwide. Over recent years, marketing films to the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has become a multi-million dollar industry. Last year, the academy formed a committee to tighten the rules after the campaigns spilled over into personal attacks between studios. Academy president Frank Pierson praised Gibson's move for working to restore the Oscars as a "celebration and appreciation of excellence," and resisting the "crass commercialisation that was threatening the integrity of the award".

The asyncio.run() function to run the top-level entry point “main()” function (see the above example.)

Awaiting on a coroutine. The following snippet of code will print “hello” after waiting for 1 second, and then print “world” after waiting for another 2 seconds:

import asyncio
import time

async def say_after(delay, what):
    await asyncio.sleep(delay)
    print(what)

async def main():
    print(f"started at {time.strftime('%X')}")

    await say_after(1, 'hello')
    await say_after(2, 'world')

    print(f"finished at {time.strftime('%X')}")

asyncio.run(main())
Expected output:

started at 17:13:52
hello
world
finished at 17:13:55
The asyncio.create_task() function to run coroutines concurrently as asyncio Tasks.

Let’s modify the above example and run two say_after coroutines concurrently:

async def main():
    task1 = asyncio.create_task(
        say_after(1, 'hello'))

    task2 = asyncio.create_task(
        say_after(2, 'world'))

    print(f"started at {time.strftime('%X')}")

    # Wait until both tasks are completed (should take
    # around 2 seconds.)
    await task1
    await task2

    print(f"finished at {time.strftime('%X')}")
Note that expected output now shows that the snippet runs 1 second faster than before:

started at 17:14:32
hello
world
finished at 17:14:34
Awaitables
We say that an object is an awaitable object if it can be used in an await expression. Many asyncio APIs are designed to accept awaitables.

There are three main types of awaitable objects: coroutines, Tasks, and Futures.

Coroutines

Python coroutines are awaitables and therefore can be awaited from other coroutines:

import asyncio

async def nested():
    return 42

async def main():
    # Nothing happens if we just call "nested()".
    # A coroutine object is created but not awaited,
    # so it *won't run at all*.
    nested()

    # Let's do it differently now and await it:
    print(await nested())  # will print "42".

asyncio.run(main())
Important In this documentation the term “coroutine” can be used for two closely related concepts:
a coroutine function: an async def function;

a coroutine object: an object returned by calling a coroutine function.

asyncio also supports legacy generator-based coroutines.

Tasks

Tasks are used to schedule coroutines concurrently.

When a coroutine is wrapped into a Task with functions like asyncio.create_task() the coroutine is automatically scheduled to run soon:

import asyncio

async def nested():
    return 42

async def main():
    # Schedule nested() to run soon concurrently
    # with "main()".
    task = asyncio.create_task(nested())

    # "task" can now be used to cancel "nested()", or
    # can simply be awaited to wait until it is complete:
    await task

asyncio.run(main())
Futures

A Future is a special low-level awaitable object that represents an eventual result of an asynchronous operation.

When a Future object is awaited it means that the coroutine will wait until the Future is resolved in some other place.

Future objects in asyncio are needed to allow callback-based code to be used with async/await.

Normally there is no need to create Future objects at the application level code.

Future objects, sometimes exposed by libraries and some asyncio APIs, can be awaited:

async def main():
    await function_that_returns_a_future_object()

    # this is also valid:
    await asyncio.gather(
        function_that_returns_a_future_object(),
        some_python_coroutine()
    )
A good example of a low-level function that returns a Future object is loop.run_in_executor().

Running an asyncio Program
asyncio.run(coro, *, debug=False)
Execute the coroutine coro and return the result.

This function runs the passed coroutine, taking care of managing the asyncio event loop and finalizing asynchronous generators.

This function cannot be called when another asyncio event loop is running in the same thread.

If debug is True, the event loop will be run in debug mode.

This function always creates a new event loop and closes it at the end. It should be used as a main entry point for asyncio programs, and should ideally only be called once.

Example:

async def main():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print('hello')

asyncio.run(main())
New in version 3.7.

Note The source code for asyncio.run() can be found in Lib/asyncio/runners.py.
Creating Tasks
asyncio.create_task(coro, *, name=None)
Wrap the coro coroutine into a Task and schedule its execution. Return the Task object.

If name is not None, it is set as the name of the task using Task.set_name().

The task is executed in the loop returned by get_running_loop(), RuntimeError is raised if there is no running loop in current thread.

This function has been added in Python 3.7. Prior to Python 3.7, the low-level asyncio.ensure_future() function can be used instead:

async def coro():
    ...

# In Python 3.7+
task = asyncio.create_task(coro())
...

# This works in all Python versions but is less readable
task = asyncio.ensure_future(coro())
...
New in version 3.7.

Changed in version 3.8: Added the name parameter.

Sleeping
coroutine asyncio.sleep(delay, result=None, *, loop=None)
Block for delay seconds.

If result is provided, it is returned to the caller when the coroutine completes.

sleep() always suspends the current task, allowing other tasks to run.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example of coroutine displaying the current date every second for 5 seconds:

import asyncio
import datetime

async def display_date():
    loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
    end_time = loop.time() + 5.0
    while True:
        print(datetime.datetime.now())
        if (loop.time() + 1.0) >= end_time:
            break
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

asyncio.run(display_date())
Running Tasks Concurrently
awaitable asyncio.gather(*aws, loop=None, return_exceptions=False)
Run awaitable objects in the aws sequence concurrently.

If any awaitable in aws is a coroutine, it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

If all awaitables are completed successfully, the result is an aggregate list of returned values. The order of result values corresponds to the order of awaitables in aws.

If return_exceptions is False (default), the first raised exception is immediately propagated to the task that awaits on gather(). Other awaitables in the aws sequence won’t be cancelled and will continue to run.

If return_exceptions is True, exceptions are treated the same as successful results, and aggregated in the result list.

If gather() is cancelled, all submitted awaitables (that have not completed yet) are also cancelled.

If any Task or Future from the aws sequence is cancelled, it is treated as if it raised CancelledError – the gather() call is not cancelled in this case. This is to prevent the cancellation of one submitted Task/Future to cause other Tasks/Futures to be cancelled.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

import asyncio

async def factorial(name, number):
    f = 1
    for i in range(2, number + 1):
        print(f"Task {name}: Compute factorial({i})...")
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        f *= i
    print(f"Task {name}: factorial({number}) = {f}")

async def main():
    # Schedule three calls *concurrently*:
    await asyncio.gather(
        factorial("A", 2),
        factorial("B", 3),
        factorial("C", 4),
    )

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     Task A: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task B: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task C: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task A: factorial(2) = 2
#     Task B: Compute factorial(3)...
#     Task C: Compute factorial(3)...
#     Task B: factorial(3) = 6
#     Task C: Compute factorial(4)...
#     Task C: factorial(4) = 24
Changed in version 3.7: If the gather itself is cancelled, the cancellation is propagated regardless of return_exceptions.

Shielding From Cancellation
awaitable asyncio.shield(aw, *, loop=None)
Protect an awaitable object from being cancelled.

If aw is a coroutine it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

The statement:

res = await shield(something())
is equivalent to:

res = await something()
except that if the coroutine containing it is cancelled, the Task running in something() is not cancelled. From the point of view of something(), the cancellation did not happen. Although its caller is still cancelled, so the “await” expression still raises a CancelledError.

If something() is cancelled by other means (i.e. from within itself) that would also cancel shield().

If it is desired to completely ignore cancellation (not recommended) the shield() function should be combined with a try/except clause, as follows:

try:
    res = await shield(something())
except CancelledError:
    res = None
Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Timeouts
coroutine asyncio.wait_for(aw, timeout, *, loop=None)
Wait for the aw awaitable to complete with a timeout.

If aw is a coroutine it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

timeout can either be None or a float or int number of seconds to wait for. If timeout is None, block until the future completes.

If a timeout occurs, it cancels the task and raises asyncio.TimeoutError.

To avoid the task cancellation, wrap it in shield().

The function will wait until the future is actually cancelled, so the total wait time may exceed the timeout.

If the wait is cancelled, the future aw is also cancelled.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

async def eternity():
    # Sleep for one hour
    await asyncio.sleep(3600)
    print('yay!')

async def main():
    # Wait for at most 1 second
    try:
        await asyncio.wait_for(eternity(), timeout=1.0)
    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        print('timeout!')

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     timeout!
Changed in version 3.7: When aw is cancelled due to a timeout, wait_for waits for aw to be cancelled. Previously, it raised asyncio.TimeoutError immediately.

Waiting Primitives
coroutine asyncio.wait(aws, *, loop=None, timeout=None, return_when=ALL_COMPLETED)
Run awaitable objects in the aws set concurrently and block until the condition specified by return_when.

Returns two sets of Tasks/Futures: (done, pending).

Usage:

done, pending = await asyncio.wait(aws)
timeout (a float or int), if specified, can be used to control the maximum number of seconds to wait before returning.

Note that this function does not raise asyncio.TimeoutError. Futures or Tasks that aren’t done when the timeout occurs are simply returned in the second set.

return_when indicates when this function should return. It must be one of the following constants:

Constant

Description

FIRST_COMPLETED

The function will return when any future finishes or is cancelled.

FIRST_EXCEPTION

The function will return when any future finishes by raising an exception. If no future raises an exception then it is equivalent to ALL_COMPLETED.

ALL_COMPLETED

The function will return when all futures finish or are cancelled.

Unlike wait_for(), wait() does not cancel the futures when a timeout occurs.

Deprecated since version 3.8: If any awaitable in aws is a coroutine, it is automatically scheduled as a Task. Passing coroutines objects to wait() directly is deprecated as it leads to confusing behavior.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Note wait() schedules coroutines as Tasks automatically and later returns those implicitly created Task objects in (done, pending) sets. Therefore the following code won’t work as expected:
async def foo():
    return 42

coro = foo()
done, pending = await asyncio.wait({coro})

if coro in done:
    # This branch will never be run!
Here is how the above snippet can be fixed:

async def foo():
    return 42

task = asyncio.create_task(foo())
done, pending = await asyncio.wait({task})

if task in done:
    # Everything will work as expected now.
Deprecated since version 3.8: Passing coroutine objects to wait() directly is deprecated.

asyncio.as_completed(aws, *, loop=None, timeout=None)
Run awaitable objects in the aws set concurrently. Return an iterator of Future objects. Each Future object returned represents the earliest result from the set of the remaining awaitables.

Raises asyncio.TimeoutError if the timeout occurs before all Futures are done.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

for f in as_completed(aws):
    earliest_result = await f
    # ...
Scheduling From Other Threads
asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro, loop)
Submit a coroutine to the given event loop. Thread-safe.

Return a concurrent.futures.Future to wait for the result from another OS thread.

This function is meant to be called from a different OS thread than the one where the event loop is running. Example:

# Create a coroutine
coro = asyncio.sleep(1, result=3)

# Submit the coroutine to a given loop
future = asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro, loop)

# Wait for the result with an optional timeout argument
assert future.result(timeout) == 3
If an exception is raised in the coroutine, the returned Future will be notified. It can also be used to cancel the task in the event loop:

try:
    result = future.result(timeout)
except asyncio.TimeoutError:
    print('The coroutine took too long, cancelling the task...')
    future.cancel()
except Exception as exc:
    print(f'The coroutine raised an exception: {exc!r}')
else:
    print(f'The coroutine returned: {result!r}')
See the concurrency and multithreading section of the documentation.

Unlike other asyncio functions this function requires the loop argument to be passed explicitly.

New in version 3.5.1.

Introspection
asyncio.current_task(loop=None)
Return the currently running Task instance, or None if no task is running.

If loop is None get_running_loop() is used to get the current loop.

New in version 3.7.

asyncio.all_tasks(loop=None)
Return a set of not yet finished Task objects run by the loop.

If loop is None, get_running_loop() is used for getting current loop.

New in version 3.7.

Task Object
class asyncio.Task(coro, *, loop=None, name=None)
A Future-like object that runs a Python coroutine. Not thread-safe.

Tasks are used to run coroutines in event loops. If a coroutine awaits on a Future, the Task suspends the execution of the coroutine and waits for the completion of the Future. When the Future is done, the execution of the wrapped coroutine resumes.

Event loops use cooperative scheduling: an event loop runs one Task at a time. While a Task awaits for the completion of a Future, the event loop runs other Tasks, callbacks, or performs IO operations.

Use the high-level asyncio.create_task() function to create Tasks, or the low-level loop.create_task() or ensure_future() functions. Manual instantiation of Tasks is discouraged.

To cancel a running Task use the cancel() method. Calling it will cause the Task to throw a CancelledError exception into the wrapped coroutine. If a coroutine is awaiting on a Future object during cancellation, the Future object will be cancelled.

cancelled() can be used to check if the Task was cancelled. The method returns True if the wrapped coroutine did not suppress the CancelledError exception and was actually cancelled.

asyncio.Task inherits from Future all of its APIs except Future.set_result() and Future.set_exception().

Tasks support the contextvars module. When a Task is created it copies the current context and later runs its coroutine in the copied context.

Changed in version 3.7: Added support for the contextvars module.

Changed in version 3.8: Added the name parameter.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

cancel()
Request the Task to be cancelled.

This arranges for a CancelledError exception to be thrown into the wrapped coroutine on the next cycle of the event loop.

The coroutine then has a chance to clean up or even deny the request by suppressing the exception with a try … … except CancelledError … finally block. Therefore, unlike Future.cancel(), Task.cancel() does not guarantee that the Task will be cancelled, although suppressing cancellation completely is not common and is actively discouraged.

The following example illustrates how coroutines can intercept the cancellation request:

async def cancel_me():
    print('cancel_me(): before sleep')

    try:
        # Wait for 1 hour
        await asyncio.sleep(3600)
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print('cancel_me(): cancel sleep')
        raise
    finally:
        print('cancel_me(): after sleep')

async def main():
    # Create a "cancel_me" Task
    task = asyncio.create_task(cancel_me())

    # Wait for 1 second
    await asyncio.sleep(1)

    task.cancel()
    try:
        await task
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print("main(): cancel_me is cancelled now")

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     cancel_me(): before sleep
#     cancel_me(): cancel sleep
#     cancel_me(): after sleep
#     main(): cancel_me is cancelled now
cancelled()
Return True if the Task is cancelled.

The Task is cancelled when the cancellation was requested with cancel() and the wrapped coroutine propagated the CancelledError exception thrown into it.

done()
Return True if the Task is done.

A Task is done when the wrapped coroutine either returned a value, raised an exception, or the Task was cancelled.

result()
Return the result of the Task.

If the Task is done, the result of the wrapped coroutine is returned (or if the coroutine raised an exception, that exception is re-raised.)

If the Task has been cancelled, this method raises a CancelledError exception.

If the Task’s result isn’t yet available, this method raises a InvalidStateError exception.

exception()
Return the exception of the Task.

If the wrapped coroutine raised an exception that exception is returned. If the wrapped coroutine returned normally this method returns None.

If the Task has been cancelled, this method raises a CancelledError exception.

If the Task isn’t done yet, this method raises an InvalidStateError exception.

add_done_callback(callback, *, context=None)
Add a callback to be run when the Task is done.

This method should only be used in low-level callback-based code.

See the documentation of Future.add_done_callback() for more details.

remove_done_callback(callback)
Remove callback from the callbacks list.

This method should only be used in low-level callback-based code.

See the documentation of Future.remove_done_callback() for more details.

get_stack(*, limit=None)
Return the list of stack frames for this Task.

If the wrapped coroutine is not done, this returns the stack where it is suspended. If the coroutine has completed successfully or was cancelled, this returns an empty list. If the coroutine was terminated by an exception, this returns the list of traceback frames.

The frames are always ordered from oldest to newest.

Only one stack frame is returned for a suspended coroutine.

The optional limit argument sets the maximum number of frames to return; by default all available frames are returned. The ordering of the returned list differs depending on whether a stack or a traceback is returned: the newest frames of a stack are returned, but the oldest frames of a traceback are returned. (This matches the behavior of the traceback module.)

print_stack(*, limit=None, file=None)
Print the stack or traceback for this Task.

This produces output similar to that of the traceback module for the frames retrieved by get_stack().

The limit argument is passed to get_stack() directly.

The file argument is an I/O stream to which the output is written; by default output is written to sys.stderr.

get_coro()
Return the coroutine object wrapped by the Task.

New in version 3.8.

get_name()
Return the name of the Task.

If no name has been explicitly assigned to the Task, the default asyncio Task implementation generates a default name during instantiation.

New in version 3.8.

set_name(value)
Set the name of the Task.

The value argument can be any object, which is then converted to a string.

In the default Task implementation, the name will be visible in the repr() output of a task object.

New in version 3.8.

classmethod all_tasks(loop=None)
Return a set of all tasks for an event loop.

By default all tasks for the current event loop are returned. If loop is None, the get_event_loop() function is used to get the current loop.

Deprecated since version 3.7, will be removed in version 3.9: Do not call this as a task method. Use the asyncio.all_tasks() function instead.

classmethod current_task(loop=None)
Return the currently running task or None.

If loop is None, the get_event_loop() function is used to get the current loop.

Deprecated since version 3.7, will be removed in version 3.9: Do not call this as a task method. Use the asyncio.current_task() function instead.

Generator-based Coroutines
Note Support for generator-based coroutines is deprecated and is scheduled for removal in Python 3.10.
Generator-based coroutines predate async/await syntax. They are Python generators that use yield from expressions to await on Futures and other coroutines.

Generator-based coroutines should be decorated with @asyncio.coroutine, although this is not enforced.

@asyncio.coroutine
Decorator to mark generator-based coroutines.

This decorator enables legacy generator-based coroutines to be compatible with async/await code:

@asyncio.coroutine
def old_style_coroutine():
    yield from asyncio.sleep(1)

async def main():
    await old_style_coroutine()
This decorator should not be used for async def coroutines.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: Use async def instead.

asyncio.iscoroutine(obj)
Return True if obj is a coroutine object.

This method is different from inspect.iscoroutine() because it returns True for generator-based coroutines.

asyncio.iscoroutinefunction(func)
Return True if func is a coroutine function.

This method is different from inspect.iscoroutinefunction() because it returns True for generator-based coroutine functions decorated with @coroutine.

No UK premiere for Rings musical

The producers behind the Lord of the Rings musical have abandoned plans to premiere the show in London because no suitable theatre was available.

The £11.5m show will make its debut in Toronto in March 2006, after it was found that all three West End theatres with sufficient capacity were booked. The musical is not expected in London before December 2006. Producer Kevin Wallace said it would be "worth waiting for". "It will be like nothing they have ever seen before." "I know there will be a lot of disappointed British Tolkien fans who hoped to see the show in London, but we couldn't get a London theatre in time," added the British producer. The world premiere of the stage musical, co-produced by Canadian theatrical impresarios David and Ed Mirvish, will take place at Toronto's Princess of Wales Theatre next year.

"Toronto really wanted this premiere. The Tolkien books and films are hugely popular in Canada," said Mr Wallace, shortly after signing the deal in Canada. "We hope the anticipation and excitement over here will create an even bigger buzz by the time we open in London." Auditions begin in Canada on Thursday, but up to five British actors may join the cast, under a deal struck with Canadian Actors' Equity. The music for the show is being written by Bollywood composer AR Rahman, who was behind Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End musical Bollywood Dreams, and in conjuction with the Finnish group Varttina.

"There will be no singing and dancing Hobbits. The music will be in a very traditional mould and draw on ethnic traditions," assured Mr Wallace. The musical's British director is Matthew Warchus, best known for staging the worldwide stage hit Art. "The production will be a hybrid of text, physical theatre, music and spectacle never previously seen on this scale," he said. "Only in the theatre are we actually plunged into the events as they happen. The environment surrounds us and we are in Middle Earth." New Zealander Peter Jackson took 10 years to bring JRR Tolkien's fantasy trilogy to the big screen, winning Academy Awards for best film and best director for the final film The Return of the King in 2004.
No ads for Passion Oscar campaign

Producer Mel Gibson will not be using paid advertisements to promote The Passion of the Christ to voters in next year's Academy Awards.

Gibson and his Icon Productions partner Bruce Davey said they would not be campaigning in print, radio or TV for success at the Oscars in February. "This film should be judged on its artistic merit, not who spends more money on advertising," Davey said. But DVDs will be sent to Oscar voters, who will be invited to screenings. Icon spent very little on advertising the film, which deals with the last hours of Jesus Christ's life, when it was released earlier this year - instead, it made the film available for special screenings at churches. It went on to gross over $600m (£322m) in ticket sales worldwide. Over recent years, marketing films to the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has become a multi-million dollar industry. Last year, the academy formed a committee to tighten the rules after the campaigns spilled over into personal attacks between studios. Academy president Frank Pierson praised Gibson's move for working to restore the Oscars as a "celebration and appreciation of excellence," and resisting the "crass commercialisation that was threatening the integrity of the award".

"I know there will be a lot of disappointed British Tolkien fans who hoped to see the show in London, but we couldn't get a London theatre in time," added the British producer. The world premiere of the stage musical, co-produced by Canadian theatrical impresarios David and Ed Mirvish, will take place at Toronto's Princess of Wales Theatre next year.

"Toronto really wanted this premiere. The Tolkien books and films are hugely popular in Canada," said Mr Wallace, shortly after signing the deal in Canada. "We hope the anticipation and excitement over here will create an even bigger buzz by the time we open in London." Auditions begin in Canada on Thursday, but up to five British actors may join the cast, under a deal struck with Canadian Actors' Equity. The music for the show is being written by Bollywood composer AR Rahman, who was behind Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End musical Bollywood Dreams, and in conjuction with the Finnish group Varttina.

"There will be no singing and dancing Hobbits. The music will be in a very traditional mould and draw on ethnic traditions," assured Mr Wallace. The musical's British director is Matthew Warchus, best known for staging the worldwide stage hit Art. "The production will be a hybrid of text, physical theatre, music and spectacle never previously seen on this scale," he said. "Only in the theatre are we actually plunged into the events as they happen. The environment surrounds us and we are in Middle Earth." New Zealander Peter Jackson took 10 years to bring JRR Tolkien's fantasy trilogy to the big screen, winning Academy Awards for best film and best director for the final film The Return of the King in 2004.
No ads for Passion Oscar campaign

Producer Mel Gibson will not be using paid advertisements to promote The Passion of the Christ to voters in next year's Academy Awards.

Gibson and his Icon Productions partner Bruce Davey said they would not be campaigning in print, radio or TV for success at the Oscars in February. "This film should be judged on its artistic merit, not who spends more money on advertising," Davey said. But DVDs will be sent to Oscar voters, who will be invited to screenings. Icon spent very little on advertising the film, which deals with the last hours of Jesus Christ's life, when it was released earlier this year - instead, it made the film available for special screenings at churches. It went on to gross over $600m (£322m) in ticket sales worldwide. Over recent years, marketing films to the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has become a multi-million dollar industry. Last year, the academy formed a committee to tighten the rules after the campaigns spilled over into personal attacks between studios. Academy president Frank Pierson praised Gibson's move for working to restore the Oscars as a "celebration and appreciation of excellence," and resisting the "crass commercialisation that was threatening the integrity of the award".

A distributed system, also known as distributed computing, is a system with multiple components located on different machines that communicate and coordinate actions in order to appear as a single coherent system to the end-user.

Overview
The machines that are a part of a distributed system may be computers, physical servers, virtual machines, containers, or any other node that can connect to the network, have local memory, and communicate by passing messages.

There are two general ways that distributed systems function:

Each machine works toward a common goal and the end-user views results as one cohesive unit.
Each machine has its own end-user and the distributed system facilitates sharing resources or communication services.
Although distributed systems can sometimes be obscure, they usually have three primary characteristics: all components run concurrently, there is no global clock, and all components fail independently of each other.

Benefits and challenges of distributed systems
There are three reasons that teams generally decide to implement distributed systems:

Horizontal Scalability—Since computing happens independently on each node, it is easy and generally inexpensive to add additional nodes and functionality as necessary.
Reliability—Most distributed systems are fault-tolerant as they can be made up of hundreds of nodes that work together. The system generally doesn’t experience any disruptions if a single machine fails.
Performance—Distributed systems are extremely efficient because work loads can be broken up and sent to multiple machines.
However, distributed systems are not without challenges. Complex architectural design, construction, and debugging processes that are required to create an effective distributed system can be overwhelming.

>> import asyncio

>>> async def main():
...     print('hello')
...     await asyncio.sleep(1)
...     print('world')

>>> asyncio.run(main())
hello
world
Note that simply calling a coroutine will not schedule it to be executed:

>>>
>>> main()
<coroutine object main at 0x1053bb7c8>
To actually run a coroutine, asyncio provides three main mechanisms:

The asyncio.run() function to run the top-level entry point “main()” function (see the above example.)

Awaiting on a coroutine. The following snippet of code will print “hello” after waiting for 1 second, and then print “world” after waiting for another 2 seconds:

import asyncio
import time

async def say_after(delay, what):
    await asyncio.sleep(delay)
    print(what)

async def main():
    print(f"started at {time.strftime('%X')}")

    await say_after(1, 'hello')
    await say_after(2, 'world')

    print(f"finished at {time.strftime('%X')}")

asyncio.run(main())
Expected output:

started at 17:13:52
hello
world
finished at 17:13:55
The asyncio.create_task() function to run coroutines concurrently as asyncio Tasks.

Let’s modify the above example and run two say_after coroutines concurrently:

async def main():
    task1 = asyncio.create_task(
        say_after(1, 'hello'))

    task2 = asyncio.create_task(
        say_after(2, 'world'))

    print(f"started at {time.strftime('%X')}")

    # Wait until both tasks are completed (should take
    # around 2 seconds.)
    await task1
    await task2

    print(f"finished at {time.strftime('%X')}")
Note that expected output now shows that the snippet runs 1 second faster than before:

started at 17:14:32
hello
world
finished at 17:14:34
Awaitables
We say that an object is an awaitable object if it can be used in an await expression. Many asyncio APIs are designed to accept awaitables.

There are three main types of awaitable objects: coroutines, Tasks, and Futures.

Coroutines

Python coroutines are awaitables and therefore can be awaited from other coroutines:

import asyncio

async def nested():
    return 42

async def main():
    # Nothing happens if we just call "nested()".
    # A coroutine object is created but not awaited,
    # so it *won't run at all*.
    nested()

    # Let's do it differently now and await it:
    print(await nested())  # will print "42".

asyncio.run(main())
Important In this documentation the term “coroutine” can be used for two closely related concepts:
a coroutine function: an async def function;

a coroutine object: an object returned by calling a coroutine function.

asyncio also supports legacy generator-based coroutines.

Tasks

Tasks are used to schedule coroutines concurrently.

When a coroutine is wrapped into a Task with functions like asyncio.create_task() the coroutine is automatically scheduled to run soon:

import asyncio

async def nested():
    return 42

async def main():
    # Schedule nested() to run soon concurrently
    # with "main()".
    task = asyncio.create_task(nested())

    # "task" can now be used to cancel "nested()", or
    # can simply be awaited to wait until it is complete:
    await task

asyncio.run(main())
Futures

A Future is a special low-level awaitable object that represents an eventual result of an asynchronous operation.

When a Future object is awaited it means that the coroutine will wait until the Future is resolved in some other place.

Future objects in asyncio are needed to allow callback-based code to be used with async/await.

Normally there is no need to create Future objects at the application level code.

Future objects, sometimes exposed by libraries and some asyncio APIs, can be awaited:

async def main():
    await function_that_returns_a_future_object()

    # this is also valid:
    await asyncio.gather(
        function_that_returns_a_future_object(),
        some_python_coroutine()
    )
A good example of a low-level function that returns a Future object is loop.run_in_executor().

Running an asyncio Program
asyncio.run(coro, *, debug=False)
Execute the coroutine coro and return the result.

This function runs the passed coroutine, taking care of managing the asyncio event loop and finalizing asynchronous generators.

This function cannot be called when another asyncio event loop is running in the same thread.

If debug is True, the event loop will be run in debug mode.

This function always creates a new event loop and closes it at the end. It should be used as a main entry point for asyncio programs, and should ideally only be called once.

Example:

async def main():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print('hello')

asyncio.run(main())
New in version 3.7.

Note The source code for asyncio.run() can be found in Lib/asyncio/runners.py.
Creating Tasks
asyncio.create_task(coro, *, name=None)
Wrap the coro coroutine into a Task and schedule its execution. Return the Task object.

If name is not None, it is set as the name of the task using Task.set_name().

The task is executed in the loop returned by get_running_loop(), RuntimeError is raised if there is no running loop in current thread.

This function has been added in Python 3.7. Prior to Python 3.7, the low-level asyncio.ensure_future() function can be used instead:

async def coro():
    ...

# In Python 3.7+
task = asyncio.create_task(coro())
...

# This works in all Python versions but is less readable
task = asyncio.ensure_future(coro())
...
New in version 3.7.

Changed in version 3.8: Added the name parameter.

Sleeping
coroutine asyncio.sleep(delay, result=None, *, loop=None)
Block for delay seconds.

If result is provided, it is returned to the caller when the coroutine completes.

sleep() always suspends the current task, allowing other tasks to run.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example of coroutine displaying the current date every second for 5 seconds:

import asyncio
import datetime

async def display_date():
    loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
    end_time = loop.time() + 5.0
    while True:
        print(datetime.datetime.now())
        if (loop.time() + 1.0) >= end_time:
            break
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

asyncio.run(display_date())
Running Tasks Concurrently
awaitable asyncio.gather(*aws, loop=None, return_exceptions=False)
Run awaitable objects in the aws sequence concurrently.

If any awaitable in aws is a coroutine, it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

If all awaitables are completed successfully, the result is an aggregate list of returned values. The order of result values corresponds to the order of awaitables in aws.

If return_exceptions is False (default), the first raised exception is immediately propagated to the task that awaits on gather(). Other awaitables in the aws sequence won’t be cancelled and will continue to run.

If return_exceptions is True, exceptions are treated the same as successful results, and aggregated in the result list.

If gather() is cancelled, all submitted awaitables (that have not completed yet) are also cancelled.

If any Task or Future from the aws sequence is cancelled, it is treated as if it raised CancelledError – the gather() call is not cancelled in this case. This is to prevent the cancellation of one submitted Task/Future to cause other Tasks/Futures to be cancelled.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

import asyncio

async def factorial(name, number):
    f = 1
    for i in range(2, number + 1):
        print(f"Task {name}: Compute factorial({i})...")
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        f *= i
    print(f"Task {name}: factorial({number}) = {f}")

async def main():
    # Schedule three calls *concurrently*:
    await asyncio.gather(
        factorial("A", 2),
        factorial("B", 3),
        factorial("C", 4),
    )

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     Task A: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task B: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task C: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task A: factorial(2) = 2
#     Task B: Compute factorial(3)...
#     Task C: Compute factorial(3)...
#     Task B: factorial(3) = 6
#     Task C: Compute factorial(4)...
#     Task C: factorial(4) = 24
Changed in version 3.7: If the gather itself is cancelled, the cancellation is propagated regardless of return_exceptions.

Shielding From Cancellation
awaitable asyncio.shield(aw, *, loop=None)
Protect an awaitable object from being cancelled.

If aw is a coroutine it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

The statement:

res = await shield(something())
is equivalent to:

res = await something()
except that if the coroutine containing it is cancelled, the Task running in something() is not cancelled. From the point of view of something(), the cancellation did not happen. Although its caller is still cancelled, so the “await” expression still raises a CancelledError.

If something() is cancelled by other means (i.e. from within itself) that would also cancel shield().

If it is desired to completely ignore cancellation (not recommended) the shield() function should be combined with a try/except clause, as follows:

try:
    res = await shield(something())
except CancelledError:
    res = None
Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Timeouts
coroutine asyncio.wait_for(aw, timeout, *, loop=None)
Wait for the aw awaitable to complete with a timeout.

If aw is a coroutine it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

timeout can either be None or a float or int number of seconds to wait for. If timeout is None, block until the future completes.

If a timeout occurs, it cancels the task and raises asyncio.TimeoutError.

To avoid the task cancellation, wrap it in shield().

The function will wait until the future is actually cancelled, so the total wait time may exceed the timeout.

If the wait is cancelled, the future aw is also cancelled.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

async def eternity():
    # Sleep for one hour
    await asyncio.sleep(3600)
    print('yay!')

async def main():
    # Wait for at most 1 second
    try:
        await asyncio.wait_for(eternity(), timeout=1.0)
    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        print('timeout!')

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     timeout!
Changed in version 3.7: When aw is cancelled due to a timeout, wait_for waits for aw to be cancelled. Previously, it raised asyncio.TimeoutError immediately.

Waiting Primitives
coroutine asyncio.wait(aws, *, loop=None, timeout=None, return_when=ALL_COMPLETED)
Run awaitable objects in the aws set concurrently and block until the condition specified by return_when.

Returns two sets of Tasks/Futures: (done, pending).

Usage:

done, pending = await asyncio.wait(aws)
timeout (a float or int), if specified, can be used to control the maximum number of seconds to wait before returning.

Note that this function does not raise asyncio.TimeoutError. Futures or Tasks that aren’t done when the timeout occurs are simply returned in the second set.

return_when indicates when this function should return. It must be one of the following constants:

Constant

Description

FIRST_COMPLETED

The function will return when any future finishes or is cancelled.

FIRST_EXCEPTION

The function will return when any future finishes by raising an exception. If no future raises an exception then it is equivalent to ALL_COMPLETED.

ALL_COMPLETED

The function will return when all futures finish or are cancelled.

Unlike wait_for(), wait() does not cancel the futures when a timeout occurs.

Deprecated since version 3.8: If any awaitable in aws is a coroutine, it is automatically scheduled as a Task. Passing coroutines objects to wait() directly is deprecated as it leads to confusing behavior.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Note wait() schedules coroutines as Tasks automatically and later returns those implicitly created Task objects in (done, pending) sets. Therefore the following code won’t work as expected:
async def foo():
    return 42

coro = foo()
done, pending = await asyncio.wait({coro})

if coro in done:
    # This branch will never be run!
Here is how the above snippet can be fixed:

async def foo():
    return 42

task = asyncio.create_task(foo())
done, pending = await asyncio.wait({task})

if task in done:
    # Everything will work as expected now.
Deprecated since version 3.8: Passing coroutine objects to wait() directly is deprecated.

asyncio.as_completed(aws, *, loop=None, timeout=None)
Run awaitable objects in the aws set concurrently. Return an iterator of Future objects. Each Future object returned represents the earliest result from the set of the remaining awaitables.

Raises asyncio.TimeoutError if the timeout occurs before all Futures are done.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

for f in as_completed(aws):
    earliest_result = await f
    # ...
Scheduling From Other Threads
asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro, loop)
Submit a coroutine to the given event loop. Thread-safe.

Return a concurrent.futures.Future to wait for the result from another OS thread.

This function is meant to be called from a different OS thread than the one where the event loop is running. Example:

# Create a coroutine
coro = asyncio.sleep(1, result=3)

# Submit the coroutine to a given loop
future = asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro, loop)

# Wait for the result with an optional timeout argument
assert future.result(timeout) == 3
If an exception is raised in the coroutine, the returned Future will be notified. It can also be used to cancel the task in the event loop:

try:
    result = future.result(timeout)
except asyncio.TimeoutError:
    print('The coroutine took too long, cancelling the task...')
    future.cancel()
except Exception as exc:
    print(f'The coroutine raised an exception: {exc!r}')
else:
    print(f'The coroutine returned: {result!r}')
See the concurrency and multithreading section of the documentation.

Unlike other asyncio functions this function requires the loop argument to be passed explicitly.

New in version 3.5.1.

Introspection
asyncio.current_task(loop=None)
Return the currently running Task instance, or None if no task is running.

If loop is None get_running_loop() is used to get the current loop.

New in version 3.7.

asyncio.all_tasks(loop=None)
Return a set of not yet finished Task objects run by the loop.

If loop is None, get_running_loop() is used for getting current loop.

New in version 3.7.

Task Object
class asyncio.Task(coro, *, loop=None, name=None)
A Future-like object that runs a Python coroutine. Not thread-safe.

Tasks are used to run coroutines in event loops. If a coroutine awaits on a Future, the Task suspends the execution of the coroutine and waits for the completion of the Future. When the Future is done, the execution of the wrapped coroutine resumes.

Event loops use cooperative scheduling: an event loop runs one Task at a time. While a Task awaits for the completion of a Future, the event loop runs other Tasks, callbacks, or performs IO operations.

Use the high-level asyncio.create_task() function to create Tasks, or the low-level loop.create_task() or ensure_future() functions. Manual instantiation of Tasks is discouraged.

To cancel a running Task use the cancel() method. Calling it will cause the Task to throw a CancelledError exception into the wrapped coroutine. If a coroutine is awaiting on a Future object during cancellation, the Future object will be cancelled.

cancelled() can be used to check if the Task was cancelled. The method returns True if the wrapped coroutine did not suppress the CancelledError exception and was actually cancelled.

asyncio.Task inherits from Future all of its APIs except Future.set_result() and Future.set_exception().

Tasks support the contextvars module. When a Task is created it copies the current context and later runs its coroutine in the copied context.

Changed in version 3.7: Added support for the contextvars module.

Changed in version 3.8: Added the name parameter.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

cancel()
Request the Task to be cancelled.

This arranges for a CancelledError exception to be thrown into the wrapped coroutine on the next cycle of the event loop.

The coroutine then has a chance to clean up or even deny the request by suppressing the exception with a try … … except CancelledError … finally block. Therefore, unlike Future.cancel(), Task.cancel() does not guarantee that the Task will be cancelled, although suppressing cancellation completely is not common and is actively discouraged.

The following example illustrates how coroutines can intercept the cancellation request:

async def cancel_me():
    print('cancel_me(): before sleep')

    try:
        # Wait for 1 hour
        await asyncio.sleep(3600)
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print('cancel_me(): cancel sleep')
        raise
    finally:
        print('cancel_me(): after sleep')

async def main():
    # Create a "cancel_me" Task
    task = asyncio.create_task(cancel_me())

    # Wait for 1 second
    await asyncio.sleep(1)

    task.cancel()
    try:
        await task
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print("main(): cancel_me is cancelled now")

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     cancel_me(): before sleep
#     cancel_me(): cancel sleep
#     cancel_me(): after sleep
#     main(): cancel_me is cancelled now
cancelled()
Return True if the Task is cancelled.

The Task is cancelled when the cancellation was requested with cancel() and the wrapped coroutine propagated the CancelledError exception thrown into it.

done()
Return True if the Task is done.

A Task is done when the wrapped coroutine either returned a value, raised an exception, or the Task was cancelled.

result()
Return the result of the Task.

If the Task is done, the result of the wrapped coroutine is returned (or if the coroutine raised an exception, that exception is re-raised.)

If the Task has been cancelled, this method raises a CancelledError exception.

If the Task’s result isn’t yet available, this method raises a InvalidStateError exception.

exception()
Return the exception of the Task.

If the wrapped coroutine raised an exception that exception is returned. If the wrapped coroutine returned normally this method returns None.

If the Task has been cancelled, this method raises a CancelledError exception.

If the Task isn’t done yet, this method raises an InvalidStateError exception.

add_done_callback(callback, *, context=None)
Add a callback to be run when the Task is done.

This method should only be used in low-level callback-based code.

See the documentation of Future.add_done_callback() for more details.

remove_done_callback(callback)
Remove callback from the callbacks list.

This method should only be used in low-level callback-based code.

See the documentation of Future.remove_done_callback() for more details.

get_stack(*, limit=None)
Return the list of stack frames for this Task.

If the wrapped coroutine is not done, this returns the stack where it is suspended. If the coroutine has completed successfully or was cancelled, this returns an empty list. If the coroutine was terminated by an exception, this returns the list of traceback frames.

The frames are always ordered from oldest to newest.

Only one stack frame is returned for a suspended coroutine.

The optional limit argument sets the maximum number of frames to return; by default all available frames are returned. The ordering of the returned list differs depending on whether a stack or a traceback is returned: the newest frames of a stack are returned, but the oldest frames of a traceback are returned. (This matches the behavior of the traceback module.)

print_stack(*, limit=None, file=None)
Print the stack or traceback for this Task.

This produces output similar to that of the traceback module for the frames retrieved by get_stack().

The limit argument is passed to get_stack() directly.

The file argument is an I/O stream to which the output is written; by default output is written to sys.stderr.

get_coro()
Return the coroutine object wrapped by the Task.

New in version 3.8.

get_name()
Return the name of the Task.

If no name has been explicitly assigned to the Task, the default asyncio Task implementation generates a default name during instantiation.

New in version 3.8.

set_name(value)
Set the name of the Task.

The value argument can be any object, which is then converted to a string.

In the default Task implementation, the name will be visible in the repr() output of a task object.

New in version 3.8.

classmethod all_tasks(loop=None)
Return a set of all tasks for an event loop.

By default all tasks for the current event loop are returned. If loop is None, the get_event_loop() function is used to get the current loop.

Deprecated since version 3.7, will be removed in version 3.9: Do not call this as a task method. Use the asyncio.all_tasks() function instead.

classmethod current_task(loop=None)
Return the currently running task or None.

If loop is None, the get_event_loop() function is used to get the current loop.

Deprecated since version 3.7, will be removed in version 3.9: Do not call this as a task method. Use the asyncio.current_task() function instead.

Generator-based Coroutines
Note Support for generator-based coroutines is deprecated and is scheduled for removal in Python 3.10.
Generator-based coroutines predate async/await syntax. They are Python generators that use yield from expressions to await on Futures and other coroutines.

Generator-based coroutines should be decorated with @asyncio.coroutine, although this is not enforced.

@asyncio.coroutine
Decorator to mark generator-based coroutines.

This decorator enables legacy generator-based coroutines to be compatible with async/await code:

@asyncio.coroutine
def old_style_coroutine():
    yield from asyncio.sleep(1)

async def main():
    await old_style_coroutine()
This decorator should not be used for async def coroutines.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: Use async def instead.

asyncio.iscoroutine(obj)
Return True if obj is a coroutine object.

This method is different from inspect.iscoroutine() because it returns True for generator-based coroutines.

asyncio.iscoroutinefunction(func)
Return True if func is a coroutine function.

This method is different from inspect.iscoroutinefunction() because it returns True for generator-based coroutine functions decorated with @coroutine.

Three more challenges you may encounter include:

Scheduling—A distributed system has to decide which jobs need to run, when they should run, and where they should run. Schedulers ultimately have limitations, leading to underutilized hardware and unpredictable runtimes.
Latency—The more widely your system is distributed, the more latency you can experience with communications. This often leads to teams making tradeoffs between availability, consistency, and latency.
Observability—Gathering, processing, presenting, and monitoring hardware usage metrics for large clusters is a significant challenge.
How a Distributed System Works
Hardware and software architectures are used to maintain a distributed system. Everything must be interconnected—CPUs via the network and processes via the communication system.

Producer Mel Gibson will not be using paid advertisements to promote The Passion of the Christ to voters in next year's Academy Awards.

Gibson and his Icon Productions partner Bruce Davey said they would not be campaigning in print, radio or TV for success at the Oscars in February. "This film should be judged on its artistic merit, not who spends more money on advertising," Davey said. But DVDs will be sent to Oscar voters, who will be invited to screenings. Icon spent very little on advertising the film, which deals with the last hours of Jesus Christ's life, when it was released earlier this year - instead, it made the film available for special screenings at churches. It went on to gross over $600m (£322m) in ticket sales worldwide. Over recent years, marketing films to the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has become a multi-million dollar industry. Last year, the academy formed a committee to tighten the rules after the campaigns spilled over into personal attacks between studios. Academy president Frank Pierson praised Gibson's move for working to restore the Oscars as a "celebration and appreciation of excellence," and resisting the "crass commercialisation that was threatening the integrity of the award".
Hello world
No UK premiere for Rings musical

The producers behind the Lord of the Rings musical have abandoned plans to premiere the show in London because no suitable theatre was available.

The £11.5m show will make its debut in Toronto in March 2006, after it was found that all three West End theatres with sufficient capacity were booked. The musical is not expected in London before December 2006. Producer Kevin Wallace said it would be "worth waiting for". "It will be like nothing they have ever seen before." "I know there will be a lot of disappointed British Tolkien fans who hoped to see the show in London, but we couldn't get a London theatre in time," added the British producer. The world premiere of the stage musical, co-produced by Canadian theatrical impresarios David and Ed Mirvish, will take place at Toronto's Princess of Wales Theatre next year.

"Toronto really wanted this premiere. The Tolkien books and films are hugely popular in Canada," said Mr Wallace, shortly after signing the deal in Canada. "We hope the anticipation and excitement over here will create an even bigger buzz by the time we open in London." Auditions begin in Canada on Thursday, but up to five British actors may join the cast, under a deal struck with Canadian Actors' Equity. The music for the show is being written by Bollywood composer AR Rahman, who was behind Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End musical Bollywood Dreams, and in conjuction with the Finnish group Varttina.

"There will be no singing and dancing Hobbits. The music will be in a very traditional mould and draw on ethnic traditions," assured Mr Wallace. The musical's British director is Matthew Warchus, best known for staging the worldwide stage hit Art. "The production will be a hybrid of text, physical theatre, music and spectacle never previously seen on this scale," he said. "Only in the theatre are we actually plunged into the events as they happen. The environment surrounds us and we are in Middle Earth." New Zealander Peter Jackson took 10 years to bring JRR Tolkien's fantasy trilogy to the big screen, winning Academy Awards for best film and best director for the final film The Return of the King in 2004.

"We hope the anticipation and excitement over here will create an even bigger buzz by the time we open in London." Auditions begin in Canada on Thursday, but up to five British actors may join the cast, under a deal struck with Canadian Actors' Equity. The music for the show is being written by Bollywood composer AR Rahman, who was behind Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End musical Bollywood Dreams, and in conjuction with the Finnish group Varttina.

"There will be no singing and dancing Hobbits. The music will be in a very traditional mould and draw on ethnic traditions," assured Mr Wallace. The musical's British director is Matthew Warchus, best known for staging the worldwide stage hit Art. "The production will be a hybrid of text, physical theatre, music and spectacle never previously seen on this scale," he said. "Only in the theatre are we actually plunged into the events as they happen. The environment surrounds us and we are in Middle Earth." New Zealander Peter Jackson took 10 years to bring JRR Tolkien's fantasy trilogy to the big screen, winning Academy Awards for best film and best director for the final film The Return of the King in 2004.
No ads for Passion Oscar campaign

Producer Mel Gibson will not be using paid advertisements to promote The Passion of the Christ to voters in next year's Academy Awards.

Gibson and his Icon Productions partner Bruce Davey said they would not be campaigning in print, radio or TV for success at the Oscars in February. "This film should be judged on its artistic merit, not who spends more money on advertising," Davey said. But DVDs will be sent to Oscar voters, who will be invited to screenings. Icon spent very little on advertising the film, which deals with the last hours of Jesus Christ's life, when it was released earlier this year - instead, it made the film available for special screenings at churches. It went on to gross over $600m (£322m) in ticket sales worldwide. Over recent years, marketing films to the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has become a multi-million dollar industry. Last year, the academy formed a committee to tighten the rules after the campaigns spilled over into personal attacks between studios. Academy president Frank Pierson praised Gibson's move for working to restore the Oscars as a "celebration and appreciation of excellence," and resisting the "crass commercialisation that was threatening the integrity of the award".

No UK premiere for Rings musical

The producers behind the Lord of the Rings musical have abandoned plans to premiere the show in London because no suitable theatre was available.

The £11.5m show will make its debut in Toronto in March 2006, after it was found that all three West End theatres with sufficient capacity were booked. The musical is not expected in London before December 2006. Producer Kevin Wallace said it would be "worth waiting for". "It will be like nothing they have ever seen before." "I know there will be a lot of disappointed British Tolkien fans who hoped to see the show in London, but we couldn't get a London theatre in time," added the British producer. The world premiere of the stage musical, co-produced by Canadian theatrical impresarios David and Ed Mirvish, will take place at Toronto's Princess of Wales Theatre next year.

The asyncio.run() function to run the top-level entry point “main()” function (see the above example.)

Awaiting on a coroutine. The following snippet of code will print “hello” after waiting for 1 second, and then print “world” after waiting for another 2 seconds:

import asyncio
import time

async def say_after(delay, what):
    await asyncio.sleep(delay)
    print(what)

async def main():
    print(f"started at {time.strftime('%X')}")

    await say_after(1, 'hello')
    await say_after(2, 'world')

    print(f"finished at {time.strftime('%X')}")

asyncio.run(main())
Expected output:

started at 17:13:52
hello
world
finished at 17:13:55
The asyncio.create_task() function to run coroutines concurrently as asyncio Tasks.

Let’s modify the above example and run two say_after coroutines concurrently:

async def main():
    task1 = asyncio.create_task(
        say_after(1, 'hello'))

    task2 = asyncio.create_task(
        say_after(2, 'world'))

    print(f"started at {time.strftime('%X')}")

    # Wait until both tasks are completed (should take
    # around 2 seconds.)
    await task1
    await task2

    print(f"finished at {time.strftime('%X')}")
Note that expected output now shows that the snippet runs 1 second faster than before:

started at 17:14:32
hello
world
finished at 17:14:34
Awaitables
We say that an object is an awaitable object if it can be used in an await expression. Many asyncio APIs are designed to accept awaitables.

There are three main types of awaitable objects: coroutines, Tasks, and Futures.

Coroutines

Python coroutines are awaitables and therefore can be awaited from other coroutines:

import asyncio

async def nested():
    return 42

async def main():
    # Nothing happens if we just call "nested()".
    # A coroutine object is created but not awaited,
    # so it *won't run at all*.
    nested()

    # Let's do it differently now and await it:
    print(await nested())  # will print "42".

asyncio.run(main())
Important In this documentation the term “coroutine” can be used for two closely related concepts:
a coroutine function: an async def function;

a coroutine object: an object returned by calling a coroutine function.

asyncio also supports legacy generator-based coroutines.

Tasks

Tasks are used to schedule coroutines concurrently.

When a coroutine is wrapped into a Task with functions like asyncio.create_task() the coroutine is automatically scheduled to run soon:

import asyncio

async def nested():
    return 42

async def main():
    # Schedule nested() to run soon concurrently
    # with "main()".
    task = asyncio.create_task(nested())

    # "task" can now be used to cancel "nested()", or
    # can simply be awaited to wait until it is complete:
    await task

asyncio.run(main())
Futures

A Future is a special low-level awaitable object that represents an eventual result of an asynchronous operation.

When a Future object is awaited it means that the coroutine will wait until the Future is resolved in some other place.

Future objects in asyncio are needed to allow callback-based code to be used with async/await.

Normally there is no need to create Future objects at the application level code.

Future objects, sometimes exposed by libraries and some asyncio APIs, can be awaited:

async def main():
    await function_that_returns_a_future_object()

    # this is also valid:
    await asyncio.gather(
        function_that_returns_a_future_object(),
        some_python_coroutine()
    )
A good example of a low-level function that returns a Future object is loop.run_in_executor().

Running an asyncio Program
asyncio.run(coro, *, debug=False)
Execute the coroutine coro and return the result.

This function runs the passed coroutine, taking care of managing the asyncio event loop and finalizing asynchronous generators.

This function cannot be called when another asyncio event loop is running in the same thread.

If debug is True, the event loop will be run in debug mode.

This function always creates a new event loop and closes it at the end. It should be used as a main entry point for asyncio programs, and should ideally only be called once.

Example:

async def main():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print('hello')

asyncio.run(main())
New in version 3.7.

Note The source code for asyncio.run() can be found in Lib/asyncio/runners.py.
Creating Tasks
asyncio.create_task(coro, *, name=None)
Wrap the coro coroutine into a Task and schedule its execution. Return the Task object.

If name is not None, it is set as the name of the task using Task.set_name().

The task is executed in the loop returned by get_running_loop(), RuntimeError is raised if there is no running loop in current thread.

This function has been added in Python 3.7. Prior to Python 3.7, the low-level asyncio.ensure_future() function can be used instead:

async def coro():
    ...

# In Python 3.7+
task = asyncio.create_task(coro())
...

# This works in all Python versions but is less readable
task = asyncio.ensure_future(coro())
...
New in version 3.7.

Changed in version 3.8: Added the name parameter.

Sleeping
coroutine asyncio.sleep(delay, result=None, *, loop=None)
Block for delay seconds.

If result is provided, it is returned to the caller when the coroutine completes.

sleep() always suspends the current task, allowing other tasks to run.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example of coroutine displaying the current date every second for 5 seconds:

import asyncio
import datetime

async def display_date():
    loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
    end_time = loop.time() + 5.0
    while True:
        print(datetime.datetime.now())
        if (loop.time() + 1.0) >= end_time:
            break
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

asyncio.run(display_date())
Running Tasks Concurrently
awaitable asyncio.gather(*aws, loop=None, return_exceptions=False)
Run awaitable objects in the aws sequence concurrently.

If any awaitable in aws is a coroutine, it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

If all awaitables are completed successfully, the result is an aggregate list of returned values. The order of result values corresponds to the order of awaitables in aws.

If return_exceptions is False (default), the first raised exception is immediately propagated to the task that awaits on gather(). Other awaitables in the aws sequence won’t be cancelled and will continue to run.

If return_exceptions is True, exceptions are treated the same as successful results, and aggregated in the result list.

If gather() is cancelled, all submitted awaitables (that have not completed yet) are also cancelled.

If any Task or Future from the aws sequence is cancelled, it is treated as if it raised CancelledError – the gather() call is not cancelled in this case. This is to prevent the cancellation of one submitted Task/Future to cause other Tasks/Futures to be cancelled.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

import asyncio

async def factorial(name, number):
    f = 1
    for i in range(2, number + 1):
        print(f"Task {name}: Compute factorial({i})...")
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        f *= i
    print(f"Task {name}: factorial({number}) = {f}")

async def main():
    # Schedule three calls *concurrently*:
    await asyncio.gather(
        factorial("A", 2),
        factorial("B", 3),
        factorial("C", 4),
    )

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     Task A: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task B: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task C: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task A: factorial(2) = 2
#     Task B: Compute factorial(3)...
#     Task C: Compute factorial(3)...
#     Task B: factorial(3) = 6
#     Task C: Compute factorial(4)...
#     Task C: factorial(4) = 24
Changed in version 3.7: If the gather itself is cancelled, the cancellation is propagated regardless of return_exceptions.

Shielding From Cancellation
awaitable asyncio.shield(aw, *, loop=None)
Protect an awaitable object from being cancelled.

If aw is a coroutine it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

The statement:

res = await shield(something())
is equivalent to:

res = await something()
except that if the coroutine containing it is cancelled, the Task running in something() is not cancelled. From the point of view of something(), the cancellation did not happen. Although its caller is still cancelled, so the “await” expression still raises a CancelledError.

If something() is cancelled by other means (i.e. from within itself) that would also cancel shield().

If it is desired to completely ignore cancellation (not recommended) the shield() function should be combined with a try/except clause, as follows:

try:
    res = await shield(something())
except CancelledError:
    res = None
Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Timeouts
coroutine asyncio.wait_for(aw, timeout, *, loop=None)
Wait for the aw awaitable to complete with a timeout.

If aw is a coroutine it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

timeout can either be None or a float or int number of seconds to wait for. If timeout is None, block until the future completes.

If a timeout occurs, it cancels the task and raises asyncio.TimeoutError.

To avoid the task cancellation, wrap it in shield().

The function will wait until the future is actually cancelled, so the total wait time may exceed the timeout.

If the wait is cancelled, the future aw is also cancelled.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

async def eternity():
    # Sleep for one hour
    await asyncio.sleep(3600)
    print('yay!')

async def main():
    # Wait for at most 1 second
    try:
        await asyncio.wait_for(eternity(), timeout=1.0)
    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        print('timeout!')

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     timeout!
Changed in version 3.7: When aw is cancelled due to a timeout, wait_for waits for aw to be cancelled. Previously, it raised asyncio.TimeoutError immediately.

Waiting Primitives
coroutine asyncio.wait(aws, *, loop=None, timeout=None, return_when=ALL_COMPLETED)
Run awaitable objects in the aws set concurrently and block until the condition specified by return_when.

Returns two sets of Tasks/Futures: (done, pending).

Usage:

done, pending = await asyncio.wait(aws)
timeout (a float or int), if specified, can be used to control the maximum number of seconds to wait before returning.

Note that this function does not raise asyncio.TimeoutError. Futures or Tasks that aren’t done when the timeout occurs are simply returned in the second set.

return_when indicates when this function should return. It must be one of the following constants:

Constant

Description

FIRST_COMPLETED

The function will return when any future finishes or is cancelled.

FIRST_EXCEPTION

The function will return when any future finishes by raising an exception. If no future raises an exception then it is equivalent to ALL_COMPLETED.

ALL_COMPLETED

The function will return when all futures finish or are cancelled.

Unlike wait_for(), wait() does not cancel the futures when a timeout occurs.

Deprecated since version 3.8: If any awaitable in aws is a coroutine, it is automatically scheduled as a Task. Passing coroutines objects to wait() directly is deprecated as it leads to confusing behavior.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Note wait() schedules coroutines as Tasks automatically and later returns those implicitly created Task objects in (done, pending) sets. Therefore the following code won’t work as expected:
async def foo():
    return 42

coro = foo()
done, pending = await asyncio.wait({coro})

if coro in done:
    # This branch will never be run!
Here is how the above snippet can be fixed:

async def foo():
    return 42

task = asyncio.create_task(foo())
done, pending = await asyncio.wait({task})

if task in done:
    # Everything will work as expected now.
Deprecated since version 3.8: Passing coroutine objects to wait() directly is deprecated.

asyncio.as_completed(aws, *, loop=None, timeout=None)
Run awaitable objects in the aws set concurrently. Return an iterator of Future objects. Each Future object returned represents the earliest result from the set of the remaining awaitables.

Raises asyncio.TimeoutError if the timeout occurs before all Futures are done.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

for f in as_completed(aws):
    earliest_result = await f
    # ...
Scheduling From Other Threads
asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro, loop)
Submit a coroutine to the given event loop. Thread-safe.

Return a concurrent.futures.Future to wait for the result from another OS thread.

This function is meant to be called from a different OS thread than the one where the event loop is running. Example:

# Create a coroutine
coro = asyncio.sleep(1, result=3)

# Submit the coroutine to a given loop
future = asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro, loop)

# Wait for the result with an optional timeout argument
assert future.result(timeout) == 3
If an exception is raised in the coroutine, the returned Future will be notified. It can also be used to cancel the task in the event loop:

try:
    result = future.result(timeout)
except asyncio.TimeoutError:
    print('The coroutine took too long, cancelling the task...')
    future.cancel()
except Exception as exc:
    print(f'The coroutine raised an exception: {exc!r}')
else:
    print(f'The coroutine returned: {result!r}')
See the concurrency and multithreading section of the documentation.

Unlike other asyncio functions this function requires the loop argument to be passed explicitly.

New in version 3.5.1.

Introspection
asyncio.current_task(loop=None)
Return the currently running Task instance, or None if no task is running.

If loop is None get_running_loop() is used to get the current loop.

New in version 3.7.

asyncio.all_tasks(loop=None)
Return a set of not yet finished Task objects run by the loop.

If loop is None, get_running_loop() is used for getting current loop.

New in version 3.7.

Task Object
class asyncio.Task(coro, *, loop=None, name=None)
A Future-like object that runs a Python coroutine. Not thread-safe.

Tasks are used to run coroutines in event loops. If a coroutine awaits on a Future, the Task suspends the execution of the coroutine and waits for the completion of the Future. When the Future is done, the execution of the wrapped coroutine resumes.

Event loops use cooperative scheduling: an event loop runs one Task at a time. While a Task awaits for the completion of a Future, the event loop runs other Tasks, callbacks, or performs IO operations.

Use the high-level asyncio.create_task() function to create Tasks, or the low-level loop.create_task() or ensure_future() functions. Manual instantiation of Tasks is discouraged.

To cancel a running Task use the cancel() method. Calling it will cause the Task to throw a CancelledError exception into the wrapped coroutine. If a coroutine is awaiting on a Future object during cancellation, the Future object will be cancelled.

cancelled() can be used to check if the Task was cancelled. The method returns True if the wrapped coroutine did not suppress the CancelledError exception and was actually cancelled.

asyncio.Task inherits from Future all of its APIs except Future.set_result() and Future.set_exception().

Tasks support the contextvars module. When a Task is created it copies the current context and later runs its coroutine in the copied context.

Changed in version 3.7: Added support for the contextvars module.

Changed in version 3.8: Added the name parameter.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

cancel()
Request the Task to be cancelled.

This arranges for a CancelledError exception to be thrown into the wrapped coroutine on the next cycle of the event loop.

The coroutine then has a chance to clean up or even deny the request by suppressing the exception with a try … … except CancelledError … finally block. Therefore, unlike Future.cancel(), Task.cancel() does not guarantee that the Task will be cancelled, although suppressing cancellation completely is not common and is actively discouraged.

The following example illustrates how coroutines can intercept the cancellation request:

async def cancel_me():
    print('cancel_me(): before sleep')

    try:
        # Wait for 1 hour
        await asyncio.sleep(3600)
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print('cancel_me(): cancel sleep')
        raise
    finally:
        print('cancel_me(): after sleep')

async def main():
    # Create a "cancel_me" Task
    task = asyncio.create_task(cancel_me())

    # Wait for 1 second
    await asyncio.sleep(1)

    task.cancel()
    try:
        await task
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print("main(): cancel_me is cancelled now")

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     cancel_me(): before sleep
#     cancel_me(): cancel sleep
#     cancel_me(): after sleep
#     main(): cancel_me is cancelled now
cancelled()
Return True if the Task is cancelled.

The Task is cancelled when the cancellation was requested with cancel() and the wrapped coroutine propagated the CancelledError exception thrown into it.

done()
Return True if the Task is done.

A Task is done when the wrapped coroutine either returned a value, raised an exception, or the Task was cancelled.

result()
Return the result of the Task.

If the Task is done, the result of the wrapped coroutine is returned (or if the coroutine raised an exception, that exception is re-raised.)

If the Task has been cancelled, this method raises a CancelledError exception.

If the Task’s result isn’t yet available, this method raises a InvalidStateError exception.

exception()
Return the exception of the Task.

If the wrapped coroutine raised an exception that exception is returned. If the wrapped coroutine returned normally this method returns None.

If the Task has been cancelled, this method raises a CancelledError exception.

If the Task isn’t done yet, this method raises an InvalidStateError exception.

add_done_callback(callback, *, context=None)
Add a callback to be run when the Task is done.

This method should only be used in low-level callback-based code.

See the documentation of Future.add_done_callback() for more details.

remove_done_callback(callback)
Remove callback from the callbacks list.

This method should only be used in low-level callback-based code.

See the documentation of Future.remove_done_callback() for more details.

get_stack(*, limit=None)
Return the list of stack frames for this Task.

If the wrapped coroutine is not done, this returns the stack where it is suspended. If the coroutine has completed successfully or was cancelled, this returns an empty list. If the coroutine was terminated by an exception, this returns the list of traceback frames.

The frames are always ordered from oldest to newest.

Only one stack frame is returned for a suspended coroutine.

The optional limit argument sets the maximum number of frames to return; by default all available frames are returned. The ordering of the returned list differs depending on whether a stack or a traceback is returned: the newest frames of a stack are returned, but the oldest frames of a traceback are returned. (This matches the behavior of the traceback module.)

print_stack(*, limit=None, file=None)
Print the stack or traceback for this Task.

This produces output similar to that of the traceback module for the frames retrieved by get_stack().

The limit argument is passed to get_stack() directly.

The file argument is an I/O stream to which the output is written; by default output is written to sys.stderr.

get_coro()
Return the coroutine object wrapped by the Task.

New in version 3.8.

get_name()
Return the name of the Task.

If no name has been explicitly assigned to the Task, the default asyncio Task implementation generates a default name during instantiation.

New in version 3.8.

set_name(value)
Set the name of the Task.

The value argument can be any object, which is then converted to a string.

In the default Task implementation, the name will be visible in the repr() output of a task object.

New in version 3.8.

classmethod all_tasks(loop=None)
Return a set of all tasks for an event loop.

By default all tasks for the current event loop are returned. If loop is None, the get_event_loop() function is used to get the current loop.

Deprecated since version 3.7, will be removed in version 3.9: Do not call this as a task method. Use the asyncio.all_tasks() function instead.

classmethod current_task(loop=None)
Return the currently running task or None.

If loop is None, the get_event_loop() function is used to get the current loop.

Deprecated since version 3.7, will be removed in version 3.9: Do not call this as a task method. Use the asyncio.current_task() function instead.

Generator-based Coroutines
Note Support for generator-based coroutines is deprecated and is scheduled for removal in Python 3.10.
Generator-based coroutines predate async/await syntax. They are Python generators that use yield from expressions to await on Futures and other coroutines.

Generator-based coroutines should be decorated with @asyncio.coroutine, although this is not enforced.

@asyncio.coroutine
Decorator to mark generator-based coroutines.

This decorator enables legacy generator-based coroutines to be compatible with async/await code:

@asyncio.coroutine
def old_style_coroutine():
    yield from asyncio.sleep(1)

async def main():
    await old_style_coroutine()
This decorator should not be used for async def coroutines.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: Use async def instead.

asyncio.iscoroutine(obj)
Return True if obj is a coroutine object.

This method is different from inspect.iscoroutine() because it returns True for generator-based coroutines.

asyncio.iscoroutinefunction(func)
Return True if func is a coroutine function.

This method is different from inspect.iscoroutinefunction() because it returns True for generator-based coroutine functions decorated with @coroutine.

No UK premiere for Rings musical

The producers behind the Lord of the Rings musical have abandoned plans to premiere the show in London because no suitable theatre was available.

The £11.5m show will make its debut in Toronto in March 2006, after it was found that all three West End theatres with sufficient capacity were booked. The musical is not expected in London before December 2006. Producer Kevin Wallace said it would be "worth waiting for". "It will be like nothing they have ever seen before." "I know there will be a lot of disappointed British Tolkien fans who hoped to see the show in London, but we couldn't get a London theatre in time," added the British producer. The world premiere of the stage musical, co-produced by Canadian theatrical impresarios David and Ed Mirvish, will take place at Toronto's Princess of Wales Theatre next year.

"Toronto really wanted this premiere. The Tolkien books and films are hugely popular in Canada," said Mr Wallace, shortly after signing the deal in Canada. "We hope the anticipation and excitement over here will create an even bigger buzz by the time we open in London." Auditions begin in Canada on Thursday, but up to five British actors may join the cast, under a deal struck with Canadian Actors' Equity. The music for the show is being written by Bollywood composer AR Rahman, who was behind Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End musical Bollywood Dreams, and in conjuction with the Finnish group Varttina.

"There will be no singing and dancing Hobbits. The music will be in a very traditional mould and draw on ethnic traditions," assured Mr Wallace. The musical's British director is Matthew Warchus, best known for staging the worldwide stage hit Art. "The production will be a hybrid of text, physical theatre, music and spectacle never previously seen on this scale," he said. "Only in the theatre are we actually plunged into the events as they happen. The environment surrounds us and we are in Middle Earth." New Zealander Peter Jackson took 10 years to bring JRR Tolkien's fantasy trilogy to the big screen, winning Academy Awards for best film and best director for the final film The Return of the King in 2004.
No ads for Passion Oscar campaign

Producer Mel Gibson will not be using paid advertisements to promote The Passion of the Christ to voters in next year's Academy Awards.

Gibson and his Icon Productions partner Bruce Davey said they would not be campaigning in print, radio or TV for success at the Oscars in February. "This film should be judged on its artistic merit, not who spends more money on advertising," Davey said. But DVDs will be sent to Oscar voters, who will be invited to screenings. Icon spent very little on advertising the film, which deals with the last hours of Jesus Christ's life, when it was released earlier this year - instead, it made the film available for special screenings at churches. It went on to gross over $600m (£322m) in ticket sales worldwide. Over recent years, marketing films to the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has become a multi-million dollar industry. Last year, the academy formed a committee to tighten the rules after the campaigns spilled over into personal attacks between studios. Academy president Frank Pierson praised Gibson's move for working to restore the Oscars as a "celebration and appreciation of excellence," and resisting the "crass commercialisation that was threatening the integrity of the award".

The £11.5m show will make its debut in Toronto in March 2006, after it was found that all three West End theatres with sufficient capacity were booked. The musical is not expected in London before December 2006. Producer Kevin Wallace said it would be "worth waiting for". "It will be like nothing they have ever seen before." "I know there will be a lot of disappointed British Tolkien fans who hoped to see the show in London, but we couldn't get a London theatre in time," added the British producer. The world premiere of the stage musical, co-produced by Canadian theatrical impresarios David and Ed Mirvish, will take place at Toronto's Princess of Wales Theatre next year.

"Toronto really wanted this premiere. The Tolkien books and films are hugely popular in Canada," said Mr Wallace, shortly after signing the deal in Canada. "We hope the anticipation and excitement over here will create an even bigger buzz by the time we open in London." Auditions begin in Canada on Thursday, but up to five British actors may join the cast, under a deal struck with Canadian Actors' Equity. The music for the show is being written by Bollywood composer AR Rahman, who was behind Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End musical Bollywood Dreams, and in conjuction with the Finnish group Varttina.

"There will be no singing and dancing Hobbits. The music will be in a very traditional mould and draw on ethnic traditions," assured Mr Wallace. The musical's British director is Matthew Warchus, best known for staging the worldwide stage hit Art. "The production will be a hybrid of text, physical theatre, music and spectacle never previously seen on this scale," he said. "Only in the theatre are we actually plunged into the events as they happen. The environment surrounds us and we are in Middle Earth." New Zealander Peter Jackson took 10 years to bring JRR Tolkien's fantasy trilogy to the big screen, winning Academy Awards for best film and best director for the final film The Return of the King in 2004.
No ads for Passion Oscar campaign

Producer Mel Gibson will not be using paid advertisements to promote The Passion of the Christ to voters in next year's Academy Awards.

Gibson and his Icon Productions partner Bruce Davey said they would not be campaigning in print, radio or TV for success at the Oscars in February. "This film should be judged on its artistic merit, not who spends more money on advertising," Davey said. But DVDs will be sent to Oscar voters, who will be invited to screenings. Icon spent very little on advertising the film, which deals with the last hours of Jesus Christ's life, when it was released earlier this year - instead, it made the film available for special screenings at churches. It went on to gross over $600m (£322m) in ticket sales worldwide. Over recent years, marketing films to the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has become a multi-million dollar industry. Last year, the academy formed a committee to tighten the rules after the campaigns spilled over into personal attacks between studios. Academy president Frank Pierson praised Gibson's move for working to restore the Oscars as a "celebration and appreciation of excellence," and resisting the "crass commercialisation that was threatening the integrity of the award".

A distributed system, also known as distributed computing, is a system with multiple components located on different machines that communicate and coordinate actions in order to appear as a single coherent system to the end-user.

Overview
The machines that are a part of a distributed system may be computers, physical servers, virtual machines, containers, or any other node that can connect to the network, have local memory, and communicate by passing messages.

There are two general ways that distributed systems function:

Each machine works toward a common goal and the end-user views results as one cohesive unit.
Each machine has its own end-user and the distributed system facilitates sharing resources or communication services.
Although distributed systems can sometimes be obscure, they usually have three primary characteristics: all components run concurrently, there is no global clock, and all components fail independently of each other.

Benefits and challenges of distributed systems
There are three reasons that teams generally decide to implement distributed systems:

Horizontal Scalability—Since computing happens independently on each node, it is easy and generally inexpensive to add additional nodes and functionality as necessary.
Reliability—Most distributed systems are fault-tolerant as they can be made up of hundreds of nodes that work together. The system generally doesn’t experience any disruptions if a single machine fails.
Performance—Distributed systems are extremely efficient because work loads can be broken up and sent to multiple machines.
However, distributed systems are not without challenges. Complex architectural design, construction, and debugging processes that are required to create an effective distributed system can be overwhelming.

>> import asyncio

>>> async def main():
...     print('hello')
...     await asyncio.sleep(1)
...     print('world')

>>> asyncio.run(main())
hello
world
Note that simply calling a coroutine will not schedule it to be executed:

>>>
>>> main()
<coroutine object main at 0x1053bb7c8>
To actually run a coroutine, asyncio provides three main mechanisms:

The asyncio.run() function to run the top-level entry point “main()” function (see the above example.)

Awaiting on a coroutine. The following snippet of code will print “hello” after waiting for 1 second, and then print “world” after waiting for another 2 seconds:

import asyncio
import time

async def say_after(delay, what):
    await asyncio.sleep(delay)
    print(what)

async def main():
    print(f"started at {time.strftime('%X')}")

    await say_after(1, 'hello')
    await say_after(2, 'world')

    print(f"finished at {time.strftime('%X')}")

asyncio.run(main())
Expected output:

started at 17:13:52
hello
world
finished at 17:13:55
The asyncio.create_task() function to run coroutines concurrently as asyncio Tasks.

Let’s modify the above example and run two say_after coroutines concurrently:

async def main():
    task1 = asyncio.create_task(
        say_after(1, 'hello'))

    task2 = asyncio.create_task(
        say_after(2, 'world'))

    print(f"started at {time.strftime('%X')}")

    # Wait until both tasks are completed (should take
    # around 2 seconds.)
    await task1
    await task2

    print(f"finished at {time.strftime('%X')}")
Note that expected output now shows that the snippet runs 1 second faster than before:

started at 17:14:32
hello
world
finished at 17:14:34
Awaitables
We say that an object is an awaitable object if it can be used in an await expression. Many asyncio APIs are designed to accept awaitables.

There are three main types of awaitable objects: coroutines, Tasks, and Futures.

Coroutines

Python coroutines are awaitables and therefore can be awaited from other coroutines:

import asyncio

async def nested():
    return 42

async def main():
    # Nothing happens if we just call "nested()".
    # A coroutine object is created but not awaited,
    # so it *won't run at all*.
    nested()

    # Let's do it differently now and await it:
    print(await nested())  # will print "42".

asyncio.run(main())
Important In this documentation the term “coroutine” can be used for two closely related concepts:
a coroutine function: an async def function;

a coroutine object: an object returned by calling a coroutine function.

asyncio also supports legacy generator-based coroutines.

Tasks

Tasks are used to schedule coroutines concurrently.

When a coroutine is wrapped into a Task with functions like asyncio.create_task() the coroutine is automatically scheduled to run soon:

import asyncio

async def nested():
    return 42

async def main():
    # Schedule nested() to run soon concurrently
    # with "main()".
    task = asyncio.create_task(nested())

    # "task" can now be used to cancel "nested()", or
    # can simply be awaited to wait until it is complete:
    await task

asyncio.run(main())
Futures

A Future is a special low-level awaitable object that represents an eventual result of an asynchronous operation.

When a Future object is awaited it means that the coroutine will wait until the Future is resolved in some other place.

Future objects in asyncio are needed to allow callback-based code to be used with async/await.

Normally there is no need to create Future objects at the application level code.

Future objects, sometimes exposed by libraries and some asyncio APIs, can be awaited:

async def main():
    await function_that_returns_a_future_object()

    # this is also valid:
    await asyncio.gather(
        function_that_returns_a_future_object(),
        some_python_coroutine()
    )
A good example of a low-level function that returns a Future object is loop.run_in_executor().

Running an asyncio Program
asyncio.run(coro, *, debug=False)
Execute the coroutine coro and return the result.

This function runs the passed coroutine, taking care of managing the asyncio event loop and finalizing asynchronous generators.

This function cannot be called when another asyncio event loop is running in the same thread.

If debug is True, the event loop will be run in debug mode.

This function always creates a new event loop and closes it at the end. It should be used as a main entry point for asyncio programs, and should ideally only be called once.

Example:

async def main():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print('hello')

asyncio.run(main())
New in version 3.7.

Note The source code for asyncio.run() can be found in Lib/asyncio/runners.py.
Creating Tasks
asyncio.create_task(coro, *, name=None)
Wrap the coro coroutine into a Task and schedule its execution. Return the Task object.

If name is not None, it is set as the name of the task using Task.set_name().

The task is executed in the loop returned by get_running_loop(), RuntimeError is raised if there is no running loop in current thread.

This function has been added in Python 3.7. Prior to Python 3.7, the low-level asyncio.ensure_future() function can be used instead:

async def coro():
    ...

# In Python 3.7+
task = asyncio.create_task(coro())
...

# This works in all Python versions but is less readable
task = asyncio.ensure_future(coro())
...
New in version 3.7.

Changed in version 3.8: Added the name parameter.

Sleeping
coroutine asyncio.sleep(delay, result=None, *, loop=None)
Block for delay seconds.

If result is provided, it is returned to the caller when the coroutine completes.

sleep() always suspends the current task, allowing other tasks to run.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example of coroutine displaying the current date every second for 5 seconds:

import asyncio
import datetime

async def display_date():
    loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
    end_time = loop.time() + 5.0
    while True:
        print(datetime.datetime.now())
        if (loop.time() + 1.0) >= end_time:
            break
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

asyncio.run(display_date())
Running Tasks Concurrently
awaitable asyncio.gather(*aws, loop=None, return_exceptions=False)
Run awaitable objects in the aws sequence concurrently.

If any awaitable in aws is a coroutine, it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

If all awaitables are completed successfully, the result is an aggregate list of returned values. The order of result values corresponds to the order of awaitables in aws.

If return_exceptions is False (default), the first raised exception is immediately propagated to the task that awaits on gather(). Other awaitables in the aws sequence won’t be cancelled and will continue to run.

If return_exceptions is True, exceptions are treated the same as successful results, and aggregated in the result list.

If gather() is cancelled, all submitted awaitables (that have not completed yet) are also cancelled.

If any Task or Future from the aws sequence is cancelled, it is treated as if it raised CancelledError – the gather() call is not cancelled in this case. This is to prevent the cancellation of one submitted Task/Future to cause other Tasks/Futures to be cancelled.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

import asyncio

async def factorial(name, number):
    f = 1
    for i in range(2, number + 1):
        print(f"Task {name}: Compute factorial({i})...")
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        f *= i
    print(f"Task {name}: factorial({number}) = {f}")

async def main():
    # Schedule three calls *concurrently*:
    await asyncio.gather(
        factorial("A", 2),
        factorial("B", 3),
        factorial("C", 4),
    )

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     Task A: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task B: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task C: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task A: factorial(2) = 2
#     Task B: Compute factorial(3)...
#     Task C: Compute factorial(3)...
#     Task B: factorial(3) = 6
#     Task C: Compute factorial(4)...
#     Task C: factorial(4) = 24
Changed in version 3.7: If the gather itself is cancelled, the cancellation is propagated regardless of return_exceptions.

Shielding From Cancellation
awaitable asyncio.shield(aw, *, loop=None)
Protect an awaitable object from being cancelled.

If aw is a coroutine it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

The statement:

res = await shield(something())
is equivalent to:

res = await something()
except that if the coroutine containing it is cancelled, the Task running in something() is not cancelled. From the point of view of something(), the cancellation did not happen. Although its caller is still cancelled, so the “await” expression still raises a CancelledError.

If something() is cancelled by other means (i.e. from within itself) that would also cancel shield().

If it is desired to completely ignore cancellation (not recommended) the shield() function should be combined with a try/except clause, as follows:

try:
    res = await shield(something())
except CancelledError:
    res = None
Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Timeouts
coroutine asyncio.wait_for(aw, timeout, *, loop=None)
Wait for the aw awaitable to complete with a timeout.

If aw is a coroutine it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

timeout can either be None or a float or int number of seconds to wait for. If timeout is None, block until the future completes.

If a timeout occurs, it cancels the task and raises asyncio.TimeoutError.

To avoid the task cancellation, wrap it in shield().

The function will wait until the future is actually cancelled, so the total wait time may exceed the timeout.

If the wait is cancelled, the future aw is also cancelled.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

async def eternity():
    # Sleep for one hour
    await asyncio.sleep(3600)
    print('yay!')

async def main():
    # Wait for at most 1 second
    try:
        await asyncio.wait_for(eternity(), timeout=1.0)
    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        print('timeout!')

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     timeout!
Changed in version 3.7: When aw is cancelled due to a timeout, wait_for waits for aw to be cancelled. Previously, it raised asyncio.TimeoutError immediately.

Waiting Primitives
coroutine asyncio.wait(aws, *, loop=None, timeout=None, return_when=ALL_COMPLETED)
Run awaitable objects in the aws set concurrently and block until the condition specified by return_when.

Returns two sets of Tasks/Futures: (done, pending).

Usage:

done, pending = await asyncio.wait(aws)
timeout (a float or int), if specified, can be used to control the maximum number of seconds to wait before returning.

Note that this function does not raise asyncio.TimeoutError. Futures or Tasks that aren’t done when the timeout occurs are simply returned in the second set.

return_when indicates when this function should return. It must be one of the following constants:

Constant

Description

FIRST_COMPLETED

The function will return when any future finishes or is cancelled.

FIRST_EXCEPTION

The function will return when any future finishes by raising an exception. If no future raises an exception then it is equivalent to ALL_COMPLETED.

ALL_COMPLETED

The function will return when all futures finish or are cancelled.

Unlike wait_for(), wait() does not cancel the futures when a timeout occurs.

Deprecated since version 3.8: If any awaitable in aws is a coroutine, it is automatically scheduled as a Task. Passing coroutines objects to wait() directly is deprecated as it leads to confusing behavior.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Note wait() schedules coroutines as Tasks automatically and later returns those implicitly created Task objects in (done, pending) sets. Therefore the following code won’t work as expected:
async def foo():
    return 42

coro = foo()
done, pending = await asyncio.wait({coro})

if coro in done:
    # This branch will never be run!
Here is how the above snippet can be fixed:

async def foo():
    return 42

task = asyncio.create_task(foo())
done, pending = await asyncio.wait({task})

if task in done:
    # Everything will work as expected now.
Deprecated since version 3.8: Passing coroutine objects to wait() directly is deprecated.

asyncio.as_completed(aws, *, loop=None, timeout=None)
Run awaitable objects in the aws set concurrently. Return an iterator of Future objects. Each Future object returned represents the earliest result from the set of the remaining awaitables.

Raises asyncio.TimeoutError if the timeout occurs before all Futures are done.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

for f in as_completed(aws):
    earliest_result = await f
    # ...
Scheduling From Other Threads
asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro, loop)
Submit a coroutine to the given event loop. Thread-safe.

Return a concurrent.futures.Future to wait for the result from another OS thread.

This function is meant to be called from a different OS thread than the one where the event loop is running. Example:

# Create a coroutine
coro = asyncio.sleep(1, result=3)

# Submit the coroutine to a given loop
future = asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro, loop)

# Wait for the result with an optional timeout argument
assert future.result(timeout) == 3
If an exception is raised in the coroutine, the returned Future will be notified. It can also be used to cancel the task in the event loop:

try:
    result = future.result(timeout)
except asyncio.TimeoutError:
    print('The coroutine took too long, cancelling the task...')
    future.cancel()
except Exception as exc:
    print(f'The coroutine raised an exception: {exc!r}')
else:
    print(f'The coroutine returned: {result!r}')
See the concurrency and multithreading section of the documentation.

Unlike other asyncio functions this function requires the loop argument to be passed explicitly.

New in version 3.5.1.

Introspection
asyncio.current_task(loop=None)
Return the currently running Task instance, or None if no task is running.

If loop is None get_running_loop() is used to get the current loop.

New in version 3.7.

asyncio.all_tasks(loop=None)
Return a set of not yet finished Task objects run by the loop.

If loop is None, get_running_loop() is used for getting current loop.

New in version 3.7.

Task Object
class asyncio.Task(coro, *, loop=None, name=None)
A Future-like object that runs a Python coroutine. Not thread-safe.

Tasks are used to run coroutines in event loops. If a coroutine awaits on a Future, the Task suspends the execution of the coroutine and waits for the completion of the Future. When the Future is done, the execution of the wrapped coroutine resumes.

Event loops use cooperative scheduling: an event loop runs one Task at a time. While a Task awaits for the completion of a Future, the event loop runs other Tasks, callbacks, or performs IO operations.

Use the high-level asyncio.create_task() function to create Tasks, or the low-level loop.create_task() or ensure_future() functions. Manual instantiation of Tasks is discouraged.

To cancel a running Task use the cancel() method. Calling it will cause the Task to throw a CancelledError exception into the wrapped coroutine. If a coroutine is awaiting on a Future object during cancellation, the Future object will be cancelled.

cancelled() can be used to check if the Task was cancelled. The method returns True if the wrapped coroutine did not suppress the CancelledError exception and was actually cancelled.

asyncio.Task inherits from Future all of its APIs except Future.set_result() and Future.set_exception().

Tasks support the contextvars module. When a Task is created it copies the current context and later runs its coroutine in the copied context.

Changed in version 3.7: Added support for the contextvars module.

Changed in version 3.8: Added the name parameter.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

cancel()
Request the Task to be cancelled.

This arranges for a CancelledError exception to be thrown into the wrapped coroutine on the next cycle of the event loop.

The coroutine then has a chance to clean up or even deny the request by suppressing the exception with a try … … except CancelledError … finally block. Therefore, unlike Future.cancel(), Task.cancel() does not guarantee that the Task will be cancelled, although suppressing cancellation completely is not common and is actively discouraged.

The following example illustrates how coroutines can intercept the cancellation request:

async def cancel_me():
    print('cancel_me(): before sleep')

    try:
        # Wait for 1 hour
        await asyncio.sleep(3600)
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print('cancel_me(): cancel sleep')
        raise
    finally:
        print('cancel_me(): after sleep')

async def main():
    # Create a "cancel_me" Task
    task = asyncio.create_task(cancel_me())

    # Wait for 1 second
    await asyncio.sleep(1)

    task.cancel()
    try:
        await task
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print("main(): cancel_me is cancelled now")

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     cancel_me(): before sleep
#     cancel_me(): cancel sleep
#     cancel_me(): after sleep
#     main(): cancel_me is cancelled now
cancelled()
Return True if the Task is cancelled.

The Task is cancelled when the cancellation was requested with cancel() and the wrapped coroutine propagated the CancelledError exception thrown into it.

done()
Return True if the Task is done.

A Task is done when the wrapped coroutine either returned a value, raised an exception, or the Task was cancelled.

result()
Return the result of the Task.

If the Task is done, the result of the wrapped coroutine is returned (or if the coroutine raised an exception, that exception is re-raised.)

If the Task has been cancelled, this method raises a CancelledError exception.

If the Task’s result isn’t yet available, this method raises a InvalidStateError exception.

exception()
Return the exception of the Task.

If the wrapped coroutine raised an exception that exception is returned. If the wrapped coroutine returned normally this method returns None.

If the Task has been cancelled, this method raises a CancelledError exception.

If the Task isn’t done yet, this method raises an InvalidStateError exception.

add_done_callback(callback, *, context=None)
Add a callback to be run when the Task is done.

This method should only be used in low-level callback-based code.

See the documentation of Future.add_done_callback() for more details.

remove_done_callback(callback)
Remove callback from the callbacks list.

This method should only be used in low-level callback-based code.

See the documentation of Future.remove_done_callback() for more details.

get_stack(*, limit=None)
Return the list of stack frames for this Task.

If the wrapped coroutine is not done, this returns the stack where it is suspended. If the coroutine has completed successfully or was cancelled, this returns an empty list. If the coroutine was terminated by an exception, this returns the list of traceback frames.

The frames are always ordered from oldest to newest.

Only one stack frame is returned for a suspended coroutine.

The optional limit argument sets the maximum number of frames to return; by default all available frames are returned. The ordering of the returned list differs depending on whether a stack or a traceback is returned: the newest frames of a stack are returned, but the oldest frames of a traceback are returned. (This matches the behavior of the traceback module.)

print_stack(*, limit=None, file=None)
Print the stack or traceback for this Task.

This produces output similar to that of the traceback module for the frames retrieved by get_stack().

The limit argument is passed to get_stack() directly.

The file argument is an I/O stream to which the output is written; by default output is written to sys.stderr.

get_coro()
Return the coroutine object wrapped by the Task.

New in version 3.8.

get_name()
Return the name of the Task.

If no name has been explicitly assigned to the Task, the default asyncio Task implementation generates a default name during instantiation.

New in version 3.8.

set_name(value)
Set the name of the Task.

The value argument can be any object, which is then converted to a string.

In the default Task implementation, the name will be visible in the repr() output of a task object.

New in version 3.8.

classmethod all_tasks(loop=None)
Return a set of all tasks for an event loop.

By default all tasks for the current event loop are returned. If loop is None, the get_event_loop() function is used to get the current loop.

Deprecated since version 3.7, will be removed in version 3.9: Do not call this as a task method. Use the asyncio.all_tasks() function instead.

classmethod current_task(loop=None)
Return the currently running task or None.

If loop is None, the get_event_loop() function is used to get the current loop.

Deprecated since version 3.7, will be removed in version 3.9: Do not call this as a task method. Use the asyncio.current_task() function instead.

Generator-based Coroutines
Note Support for generator-based coroutines is deprecated and is scheduled for removal in Python 3.10.
Generator-based coroutines predate async/await syntax. They are Python generators that use yield from expressions to await on Futures and other coroutines.

Generator-based coroutines should be decorated with @asyncio.coroutine, although this is not enforced.

@asyncio.coroutine
Decorator to mark generator-based coroutines.

This decorator enables legacy generator-based coroutines to be compatible with async/await code:

@asyncio.coroutine
def old_style_coroutine():
    yield from asyncio.sleep(1)

async def main():
    await old_style_coroutine()
This decorator should not be used for async def coroutines.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: Use async def instead.

asyncio.iscoroutine(obj)
Return True if obj is a coroutine object.

This method is different from inspect.iscoroutine() because it returns True for generator-based coroutines.

asyncio.iscoroutinefunction(func)
Return True if func is a coroutine function.

This method is different from inspect.iscoroutinefunction() because it returns True for generator-based coroutine functions decorated with @coroutine.

Three more challenges you may encounter include:

Scheduling—A distributed system has to decide which jobs need to run, when they should run, and where they should run. Schedulers ultimately have limitations, leading to underutilized hardware and unpredictable runtimes.
Latency—The more widely your system is distributed, the more latency you can experience with communications. This often leads to teams making tradeoffs between availability, consistency, and latency.
Observability—Gathering, processing, presenting, and monitoring hardware usage metrics for large clusters is a significant challenge.
How a Distributed System Works
Hardware and software architectures are used to maintain a distributed system. Everything must be interconnected—CPUs via the network and processes via the communication system.

Producer Mel Gibson will not be using paid advertisements to promote The Passion of the Christ to voters in next year's Academy Awards.

Gibson and his Icon Productions partner Bruce Davey said they would not be campaigning in print, radio or TV for success at the Oscars in February. "This film should be judged on its artistic merit, not who spends more money on advertising," Davey said. But DVDs will be sent to Oscar voters, who will be invited to screenings. Icon spent very little on advertising the film, which deals with the last hours of Jesus Christ's life, when it was released earlier this year - instead, it made the film available for special screenings at churches. It went on to gross over $600m (£322m) in ticket sales worldwide. Over recent years, marketing films to the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has become a multi-million dollar industry. Last year, the academy formed a committee to tighten the rules after the campaigns spilled over into personal attacks between studios. Academy president Frank Pierson praised Gibson's move for working to restore the Oscars as a "celebration and appreciation of excellence," and resisting the "crass commercialisation that was threatening the integrity of the award".

No UK premiere for Rings musical

The producers behind the Lord of the Rings musical have abandoned plans to premiere the show in London because no suitable theatre was available.

The £11.5m show will make its debut in Toronto in March 2006, after it was found that all three West End theatres with sufficient capacity were booked. The musical is not expected in London before December 2006. Producer Kevin Wallace said it would be "worth waiting for". "It will be like nothing they have ever seen before." "I know there will be a lot of disappointed British Tolkien fans who hoped to see the show in London, but we couldn't get a London theatre in time," added the British producer. The world premiere of the stage musical, co-produced by Canadian theatrical impresarios David and Ed Mirvish, will take place at Toronto's Princess of Wales Theatre next year.

"Toronto really wanted this premiere. The Tolkien books and films are hugely popular in Canada," said Mr Wallace, shortly after signing the deal in Canada. "We hope the anticipation and excitement over here will create an even bigger buzz by the time we open in London." Auditions begin in Canada on Thursday, but up to five British actors may join the cast, under a deal struck with Canadian Actors' Equity. The music for the show is being written by Bollywood composer AR Rahman, who was behind Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End musical Bollywood Dreams, and in conjuction with the Finnish group Varttina.

"There will be no singing and dancing Hobbits. The music will be in a very traditional mould and draw on ethnic traditions," assured Mr Wallace. The musical's British director is Matthew Warchus, best known for staging the worldwide stage hit Art. "The production will be a hybrid of text, physical theatre, music and spectacle never previously seen on this scale," he said. "Only in the theatre are we actually plunged into the events as they happen. The environment surrounds us and we are in Middle Earth." New Zealander Peter Jackson took 10 years to bring JRR Tolkien's fantasy trilogy to the big screen, winning Academy Awards for best film and best director for the final film The Return of the King in 2004.

The producers behind the Lord of the Rings musical have abandoned plans to premiere the show in London because no suitable theatre was available.

New Zealander Peter Jackson took 10 years to bring JRR Tolkien's fantasy trilogy to the big screen, winning Academy Awards for best film and best director for the final film The Return of the King in 2004.
No ads for Passion Oscar campaign

Producer Mel Gibson will not be using paid advertisements to promote The Passion of the Christ to voters in next year's Academy Awards.

Gibson and his Icon Productions partner Bruce Davey said they would not be campaigning in print, radio or TV for success at the Oscars in February. "This film should be judged on its artistic merit, not who spends more money on advertising," Davey said. But DVDs will be sent to Oscar voters, who will be invited to screenings. Icon spent very little on advertising the film, which deals with the last hours of Jesus Christ's life, when it was released earlier this year - instead, it made the film available for special screenings at churches. It went on to gross over $600m (£322m) in ticket sales worldwide. Over recent years, marketing films to the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has become a multi-million dollar industry. Last year, the academy formed a committee to tighten the rules after the campaigns spilled over into personal attacks between studios. Academy president Frank Pierson praised Gibson's move for working to restore the Oscars as a "celebration and appreciation of excellence," and resisting the "crass commercialisation that was threatening the integrity of the award".
Hello world
No UK premiere for Rings musical

The producers behind the Lord of the Rings musical have abandoned plans to premiere the show in London because no suitable theatre was available.

The £11.5m show will make its debut in Toronto in March 2006, after it was found that all three West End theatres with sufficient capacity were booked. The musical is not expected in London before December 2006. Producer Kevin Wallace said it would be "worth waiting for". "It will be like nothing they have ever seen before." "I know there will be a lot of disappointed British Tolkien fans who hoped to see the show in London, but we couldn't get a London theatre in time," added the British producer. The world premiere of the stage musical, co-produced by Canadian theatrical impresarios David and Ed Mirvish, will take place at Toronto's Princess of Wales Theatre next year.

"Toronto really wanted this premiere. The Tolkien books and films are hugely popular in Canada," said Mr Wallace, shortly after signing the deal in Canada. "We hope the anticipation and excitement over here will create an even bigger buzz by the time we open in London." Auditions begin in Canada on Thursday, but up to five British actors may join the cast, under a deal struck with Canadian Actors' Equity. The music for the show is being written by Bollywood composer AR Rahman, who was behind Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End musical Bollywood Dreams, and in conjuction with the Finnish group Varttina.

"There will be no singing and dancing Hobbits. The music will be in a very traditional mould and draw on ethnic traditions," assured Mr Wallace. The musical's British director is Matthew Warchus, best known for staging the worldwide stage hit Art. "The production will be a hybrid of text, physical theatre, music and spectacle never previously seen on this scale," he said. "Only in the theatre are we actually plunged into the events as they happen. The environment surrounds us and we are in Middle Earth." New Zealander Peter Jackson took 10 years to bring JRR Tolkien's fantasy trilogy to the big screen, winning Academy Awards for best film and best director for the final film The Return of the King in 2004.

The asyncio.run() function to run the top-level entry point “main()” function (see the above example.)

Awaiting on a coroutine. The following snippet of code will print “hello” after waiting for 1 second, and then print “world” after waiting for another 2 seconds:

import asyncio
import time

async def say_after(delay, what):
    await asyncio.sleep(delay)
    print(what)

async def main():
    print(f"started at {time.strftime('%X')}")

    await say_after(1, 'hello')
    await say_after(2, 'world')

    print(f"finished at {time.strftime('%X')}")

asyncio.run(main())
Expected output:

started at 17:13:52
hello
world
finished at 17:13:55
The asyncio.create_task() function to run coroutines concurrently as asyncio Tasks.

Let’s modify the above example and run two say_after coroutines concurrently:

async def main():
    task1 = asyncio.create_task(
        say_after(1, 'hello'))

    task2 = asyncio.create_task(
        say_after(2, 'world'))

    print(f"started at {time.strftime('%X')}")

    # Wait until both tasks are completed (should take
    # around 2 seconds.)
    await task1
    await task2

    print(f"finished at {time.strftime('%X')}")
Note that expected output now shows that the snippet runs 1 second faster than before:

started at 17:14:32
hello
world
finished at 17:14:34
Awaitables
We say that an object is an awaitable object if it can be used in an await expression. Many asyncio APIs are designed to accept awaitables.

There are three main types of awaitable objects: coroutines, Tasks, and Futures.

Coroutines

Python coroutines are awaitables and therefore can be awaited from other coroutines:

import asyncio

async def nested():
    return 42

async def main():
    # Nothing happens if we just call "nested()".
    # A coroutine object is created but not awaited,
    # so it *won't run at all*.
    nested()

    # Let's do it differently now and await it:
    print(await nested())  # will print "42".

asyncio.run(main())
Important In this documentation the term “coroutine” can be used for two closely related concepts:
a coroutine function: an async def function;

a coroutine object: an object returned by calling a coroutine function.

asyncio also supports legacy generator-based coroutines.

Tasks

Tasks are used to schedule coroutines concurrently.

When a coroutine is wrapped into a Task with functions like asyncio.create_task() the coroutine is automatically scheduled to run soon:

import asyncio

async def nested():
    return 42

async def main():
    # Schedule nested() to run soon concurrently
    # with "main()".
    task = asyncio.create_task(nested())

    # "task" can now be used to cancel "nested()", or
    # can simply be awaited to wait until it is complete:
    await task

asyncio.run(main())
Futures

A Future is a special low-level awaitable object that represents an eventual result of an asynchronous operation.

When a Future object is awaited it means that the coroutine will wait until the Future is resolved in some other place.

Future objects in asyncio are needed to allow callback-based code to be used with async/await.

Normally there is no need to create Future objects at the application level code.

Future objects, sometimes exposed by libraries and some asyncio APIs, can be awaited:

async def main():
    await function_that_returns_a_future_object()

    # this is also valid:
    await asyncio.gather(
        function_that_returns_a_future_object(),
        some_python_coroutine()
    )
A good example of a low-level function that returns a Future object is loop.run_in_executor().

Running an asyncio Program
asyncio.run(coro, *, debug=False)
Execute the coroutine coro and return the result.

This function runs the passed coroutine, taking care of managing the asyncio event loop and finalizing asynchronous generators.

This function cannot be called when another asyncio event loop is running in the same thread.

If debug is True, the event loop will be run in debug mode.

This function always creates a new event loop and closes it at the end. It should be used as a main entry point for asyncio programs, and should ideally only be called once.

Example:

async def main():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print('hello')

asyncio.run(main())
New in version 3.7.

Note The source code for asyncio.run() can be found in Lib/asyncio/runners.py.
Creating Tasks
asyncio.create_task(coro, *, name=None)
Wrap the coro coroutine into a Task and schedule its execution. Return the Task object.

If name is not None, it is set as the name of the task using Task.set_name().

The task is executed in the loop returned by get_running_loop(), RuntimeError is raised if there is no running loop in current thread.

This function has been added in Python 3.7. Prior to Python 3.7, the low-level asyncio.ensure_future() function can be used instead:

async def coro():
    ...

# In Python 3.7+
task = asyncio.create_task(coro())
...

# This works in all Python versions but is less readable
task = asyncio.ensure_future(coro())
...
New in version 3.7.

Changed in version 3.8: Added the name parameter.

Sleeping
coroutine asyncio.sleep(delay, result=None, *, loop=None)
Block for delay seconds.

If result is provided, it is returned to the caller when the coroutine completes.

sleep() always suspends the current task, allowing other tasks to run.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example of coroutine displaying the current date every second for 5 seconds:

import asyncio
import datetime

async def display_date():
    loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
    end_time = loop.time() + 5.0
    while True:
        print(datetime.datetime.now())
        if (loop.time() + 1.0) >= end_time:
            break
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

asyncio.run(display_date())
Running Tasks Concurrently
awaitable asyncio.gather(*aws, loop=None, return_exceptions=False)
Run awaitable objects in the aws sequence concurrently.

If any awaitable in aws is a coroutine, it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

If all awaitables are completed successfully, the result is an aggregate list of returned values. The order of result values corresponds to the order of awaitables in aws.

If return_exceptions is False (default), the first raised exception is immediately propagated to the task that awaits on gather(). Other awaitables in the aws sequence won’t be cancelled and will continue to run.

If return_exceptions is True, exceptions are treated the same as successful results, and aggregated in the result list.

If gather() is cancelled, all submitted awaitables (that have not completed yet) are also cancelled.

If any Task or Future from the aws sequence is cancelled, it is treated as if it raised CancelledError – the gather() call is not cancelled in this case. This is to prevent the cancellation of one submitted Task/Future to cause other Tasks/Futures to be cancelled.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

import asyncio

async def factorial(name, number):
    f = 1
    for i in range(2, number + 1):
        print(f"Task {name}: Compute factorial({i})...")
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        f *= i
    print(f"Task {name}: factorial({number}) = {f}")

async def main():
    # Schedule three calls *concurrently*:
    await asyncio.gather(
        factorial("A", 2),
        factorial("B", 3),
        factorial("C", 4),
    )

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     Task A: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task B: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task C: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task A: factorial(2) = 2
#     Task B: Compute factorial(3)...
#     Task C: Compute factorial(3)...
#     Task B: factorial(3) = 6
#     Task C: Compute factorial(4)...
#     Task C: factorial(4) = 24
Changed in version 3.7: If the gather itself is cancelled, the cancellation is propagated regardless of return_exceptions.

Shielding From Cancellation
awaitable asyncio.shield(aw, *, loop=None)
Protect an awaitable object from being cancelled.

If aw is a coroutine it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

The statement:

res = await shield(something())
is equivalent to:

res = await something()
except that if the coroutine containing it is cancelled, the Task running in something() is not cancelled. From the point of view of something(), the cancellation did not happen. Although its caller is still cancelled, so the “await” expression still raises a CancelledError.

If something() is cancelled by other means (i.e. from within itself) that would also cancel shield().

If it is desired to completely ignore cancellation (not recommended) the shield() function should be combined with a try/except clause, as follows:

try:
    res = await shield(something())
except CancelledError:
    res = None
Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Timeouts
coroutine asyncio.wait_for(aw, timeout, *, loop=None)
Wait for the aw awaitable to complete with a timeout.

If aw is a coroutine it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

timeout can either be None or a float or int number of seconds to wait for. If timeout is None, block until the future completes.

If a timeout occurs, it cancels the task and raises asyncio.TimeoutError.

To avoid the task cancellation, wrap it in shield().

The function will wait until the future is actually cancelled, so the total wait time may exceed the timeout.

If the wait is cancelled, the future aw is also cancelled.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

async def eternity():
    # Sleep for one hour
    await asyncio.sleep(3600)
    print('yay!')

async def main():
    # Wait for at most 1 second
    try:
        await asyncio.wait_for(eternity(), timeout=1.0)
    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        print('timeout!')

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     timeout!
Changed in version 3.7: When aw is cancelled due to a timeout, wait_for waits for aw to be cancelled. Previously, it raised asyncio.TimeoutError immediately.

Waiting Primitives
coroutine asyncio.wait(aws, *, loop=None, timeout=None, return_when=ALL_COMPLETED)
Run awaitable objects in the aws set concurrently and block until the condition specified by return_when.

Returns two sets of Tasks/Futures: (done, pending).

Usage:

done, pending = await asyncio.wait(aws)
timeout (a float or int), if specified, can be used to control the maximum number of seconds to wait before returning.

Note that this function does not raise asyncio.TimeoutError. Futures or Tasks that aren’t done when the timeout occurs are simply returned in the second set.

return_when indicates when this function should return. It must be one of the following constants:

Constant

Description

FIRST_COMPLETED

The function will return when any future finishes or is cancelled.

FIRST_EXCEPTION

The function will return when any future finishes by raising an exception. If no future raises an exception then it is equivalent to ALL_COMPLETED.

ALL_COMPLETED

The function will return when all futures finish or are cancelled.

Unlike wait_for(), wait() does not cancel the futures when a timeout occurs.

Deprecated since version 3.8: If any awaitable in aws is a coroutine, it is automatically scheduled as a Task. Passing coroutines objects to wait() directly is deprecated as it leads to confusing behavior.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Note wait() schedules coroutines as Tasks automatically and later returns those implicitly created Task objects in (done, pending) sets. Therefore the following code won’t work as expected:
async def foo():
    return 42

coro = foo()
done, pending = await asyncio.wait({coro})

if coro in done:
    # This branch will never be run!
Here is how the above snippet can be fixed:

async def foo():
    return 42

task = asyncio.create_task(foo())
done, pending = await asyncio.wait({task})

if task in done:
    # Everything will work as expected now.
Deprecated since version 3.8: Passing coroutine objects to wait() directly is deprecated.

asyncio.as_completed(aws, *, loop=None, timeout=None)
Run awaitable objects in the aws set concurrently. Return an iterator of Future objects. Each Future object returned represents the earliest result from the set of the remaining awaitables.

Raises asyncio.TimeoutError if the timeout occurs before all Futures are done.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

for f in as_completed(aws):
    earliest_result = await f
    # ...
Scheduling From Other Threads
asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro, loop)
Submit a coroutine to the given event loop. Thread-safe.

Return a concurrent.futures.Future to wait for the result from another OS thread.

This function is meant to be called from a different OS thread than the one where the event loop is running. Example:

# Create a coroutine
coro = asyncio.sleep(1, result=3)

# Submit the coroutine to a given loop
future = asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro, loop)

# Wait for the result with an optional timeout argument
assert future.result(timeout) == 3
If an exception is raised in the coroutine, the returned Future will be notified. It can also be used to cancel the task in the event loop:

try:
    result = future.result(timeout)
except asyncio.TimeoutError:
    print('The coroutine took too long, cancelling the task...')
    future.cancel()
except Exception as exc:
    print(f'The coroutine raised an exception: {exc!r}')
else:
    print(f'The coroutine returned: {result!r}')
See the concurrency and multithreading section of the documentation.

Unlike other asyncio functions this function requires the loop argument to be passed explicitly.

New in version 3.5.1.

Introspection
asyncio.current_task(loop=None)
Return the currently running Task instance, or None if no task is running.

If loop is None get_running_loop() is used to get the current loop.

New in version 3.7.

asyncio.all_tasks(loop=None)
Return a set of not yet finished Task objects run by the loop.

If loop is None, get_running_loop() is used for getting current loop.

New in version 3.7.

Task Object
class asyncio.Task(coro, *, loop=None, name=None)
A Future-like object that runs a Python coroutine. Not thread-safe.

Tasks are used to run coroutines in event loops. If a coroutine awaits on a Future, the Task suspends the execution of the coroutine and waits for the completion of the Future. When the Future is done, the execution of the wrapped coroutine resumes.

Event loops use cooperative scheduling: an event loop runs one Task at a time. While a Task awaits for the completion of a Future, the event loop runs other Tasks, callbacks, or performs IO operations.

Use the high-level asyncio.create_task() function to create Tasks, or the low-level loop.create_task() or ensure_future() functions. Manual instantiation of Tasks is discouraged.

To cancel a running Task use the cancel() method. Calling it will cause the Task to throw a CancelledError exception into the wrapped coroutine. If a coroutine is awaiting on a Future object during cancellation, the Future object will be cancelled.

cancelled() can be used to check if the Task was cancelled. The method returns True if the wrapped coroutine did not suppress the CancelledError exception and was actually cancelled.

asyncio.Task inherits from Future all of its APIs except Future.set_result() and Future.set_exception().

Tasks support the contextvars module. When a Task is created it copies the current context and later runs its coroutine in the copied context.

Changed in version 3.7: Added support for the contextvars module.

Changed in version 3.8: Added the name parameter.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

cancel()
Request the Task to be cancelled.

This arranges for a CancelledError exception to be thrown into the wrapped coroutine on the next cycle of the event loop.

The coroutine then has a chance to clean up or even deny the request by suppressing the exception with a try … … except CancelledError … finally block. Therefore, unlike Future.cancel(), Task.cancel() does not guarantee that the Task will be cancelled, although suppressing cancellation completely is not common and is actively discouraged.

The following example illustrates how coroutines can intercept the cancellation request:

async def cancel_me():
    print('cancel_me(): before sleep')

    try:
        # Wait for 1 hour
        await asyncio.sleep(3600)
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print('cancel_me(): cancel sleep')
        raise
    finally:
        print('cancel_me(): after sleep')

async def main():
    # Create a "cancel_me" Task
    task = asyncio.create_task(cancel_me())

    # Wait for 1 second
    await asyncio.sleep(1)

    task.cancel()
    try:
        await task

        print("main(): cancel_me is cancelled now")

# Expected output:
#
#     cancel_me(): before sleep
#     cancel_me(): cancel sleep
#     cancel_me(): after sleep
#     main(): cancel_me is cancelled now
cancelled()
Return True if the Task is cancelled.

The Task is cancelled when the cancellation was requested with cancel() and the wrapped coroutine propagated the CancelledError exception thrown into it.

done()
Return True if the Task is done.

A Task is done when the wrapped coroutine either returned a value, raised an exception, or the Task was cancelled.

result()
Return the result of the Task.

If the Task is done, the result of the wrapped coroutine is returned (or if the coroutine raised an exception, that exception is re-raised.)

If the Task has been cancelled, this method raises a CancelledError exception.

If the Task’s result isn’t yet available, this method raises a InvalidStateError exception.

exception()
Return the exception of the Task.

If the wrapped coroutine raised an exception that exception is returned. If the wrapped coroutine returned normally this method returns None.

If the Task has been cancelled, this method raises a CancelledError exception.

If the Task isn’t done yet, this method raises an InvalidStateError exception.

add_done_callback(callback, *, context=None)
Add a callback to be run when the Task is done.

This method should only be used in low-level callback-based code.

See the documentation of Future.add_done_callback() for more details.

remove_done_callback(callback)
Remove callback from the callbacks list.

This method should only be used in low-level callback-based code.

See the documentation of Future.remove_done_callback() for more details.

get_stack(*, limit=None)
Return the list of stack frames for this Task.

If the wrapped coroutine is not done, this returns the stack where it is suspended. If the coroutine has completed successfully or was cancelled, this returns an empty list. If the coroutine was terminated by an exception, this returns the list of traceback frames.

The frames are always ordered from oldest to newest.

Only one stack frame is returned for a suspended coroutine.

The optional limit argument sets the maximum number of frames to return; by default all available frames are returned. The ordering of the returned list differs depending on whether a stack or a traceback is returned: the newest frames of a stack are returned, but the oldest frames of a traceback are returned. (This matches the behavior of the traceback module.)

print_stack(*, limit=None, file=None)
Print the stack or traceback for this Task.

This produces output similar to that of the traceback module for the frames retrieved by get_stack().

The limit argument is passed to get_stack() directly.

The file argument is an I/O stream to which the output is written; by default output is written to sys.stderr.

get_coro()
Return the coroutine object wrapped by the Task.

New in version 3.8.

get_name()
Return the name of the Task.

If no name has been explicitly assigned to the Task, the default asyncio Task implementation generates a default name during instantiation.

New in version 3.8.

set_name(value)
Set the name of the Task.

The value argument can be any object, which is then converted to a string.

In the default Task implementation, the name will be visible in the repr() output of a task object.

New in version 3.8.

classmethod all_tasks(loop=None)
Return a set of all tasks for an event loop.

By default all tasks for the current event loop are returned. If loop is None, the get_event_loop() function is used to get the current loop.

Deprecated since version 3.7, will be removed in version 3.9: Do not call this as a task method. Use the asyncio.all_tasks() function instead.

classmethod current_task(loop=None)
Return the currently running task or None.

If loop is None, the get_event_loop() function is used to get the current loop.

Deprecated since version 3.7, will be removed in version 3.9: Do not call this as a task method. Use the asyncio.current_task() function instead.

Generator-based Coroutines
Note Support for generator-based coroutines is deprecated and is scheduled for removal in Python 3.10.
Generator-based coroutines predate async/await syntax. They are Python generators that use yield from expressions to await on Futures and other coroutines.

Generator-based coroutines should be decorated with @asyncio.coroutine, although this is not enforced.

@asyncio.coroutine
Decorator to mark generator-based coroutines.

This decorator enables legacy generator-based coroutines to be compatible with async/await code:

@asyncio.coroutine
def old_style_coroutine():
    yield from asyncio.sleep(1)

async def main():
    await old_style_coroutine()
This decorator should not be used for async def coroutines.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: Use async def instead.

asyncio.iscoroutine(obj)
Return True if obj is a coroutine object.

This method is different from inspect.iscoroutine() because it returns True for generator-based coroutines.

asyncio.iscoroutinefunction(func)
Return True if func is a coroutine function.

This method is different from inspect.iscoroutinefunction() because it returns True for generator-based coroutine functions decorated with @coroutine.

No UK premiere for Rings musical

The producers behind the Lord of the Rings musical have abandoned plans to premiere the show in London because no suitable theatre was available.

The £11.5m show will make its debut in Toronto in March 2006, after it was found that all three West End theatres with sufficient capacity were booked. The musical is not expected in London before December 2006. Producer Kevin Wallace said it would be "worth waiting for". "It will be like nothing they have ever seen before." "I know there will be a lot of disappointed British Tolkien fans who hoped to see the show in London, but we couldn't get a London theatre in time," added the British producer. The world premiere of the stage musical, co-produced by Canadian theatrical impresarios David and Ed Mirvish, will take place at Toronto's Princess of Wales Theatre next year.

"Toronto really wanted this premiere. The Tolkien books and films are hugely popular in Canada," said Mr Wallace, shortly after signing the deal in Canada. "We hope the anticipation and excitement over here will create an even bigger buzz by the time we open in London." Auditions begin in Canada on Thursday, but up to five British actors may join the cast, under a deal struck with Canadian Actors' Equity. The music for the show is being written by Bollywood composer AR Rahman, who was behind Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End musical Bollywood Dreams, and in conjuction with the Finnish group Varttina.

"There will be no singing and dancing Hobbits. The music will be in a very traditional mould and draw on ethnic traditions," assured Mr Wallace. The musical's British director is Matthew Warchus, best known for staging the worldwide stage hit Art. "The production will be a hybrid of text, physical theatre, music and spectacle never previously seen on this scale," he said. "Only in the theatre are we actually plunged into the events as they happen. The environment surrounds us and we are in Middle Earth." New Zealander Peter Jackson took 10 years to bring JRR Tolkien's fantasy trilogy to the big screen, winning Academy Awards for best film and best director for the final film The Return of the King in 2004.
No ads for Passion Oscar campaign

Producer Mel Gibson will not be using paid advertisements to promote The Passion of the Christ to voters in next year's Academy Awards.

Gibson and his Icon Productions partner Bruce Davey said they would not be campaigning in print, radio or TV for success at the Oscars in February. "This film should be judged on its artistic merit, not who spends more money on advertising," Davey said. But DVDs will be sent to Oscar voters, who will be invited to screenings. Icon spent very little on advertising the film, which deals with the last hours of Jesus Christ's life, when it was released earlier this year - instead, it made the film available for special screenings at churches. It went on to gross over $600m (£322m) in ticket sales worldwide. Over recent years, marketing films to the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has become a multi-million dollar industry. Last year, the academy formed a committee to tighten the rules after the campaigns spilled over into personal attacks between studios. Academy president Frank Pierson praised Gibson's move for working to restore the Oscars as a "celebration and appreciation of excellence," and resisting the "crass commercialisation that was threatening the integrity of the award".

"We hope the anticipation and excitement over here will create an even bigger buzz by the time we open in London." Auditions begin in Canada on Thursday, but up to five British actors may join the cast, under a deal struck with Canadian Actors' Equity. The music for the show is being written by Bollywood composer AR Rahman, who was behind Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End musical Bollywood Dreams, and in conjuction with the Finnish group Varttina.

"There will be no singing and dancing Hobbits. The music will be in a very traditional mould and draw on ethnic traditions," assured Mr Wallace. The musical's British director is Matthew Warchus, best known for staging the worldwide stage hit Art. "The production will be a hybrid of text, physical theatre, music and spectacle never previously seen on this scale," he said. "Only in the theatre are we actually plunged into the events as they happen. The environment surrounds us and we are in Middle Earth." New Zealander Peter Jackson took 10 years to bring JRR Tolkien's fantasy trilogy to the big screen, winning Academy Awards for best film and best director for the final film The Return of the King in 2004.
No ads for Passion Oscar campaign

Producer Mel Gibson will not be using paid advertisements to promote The Passion of the Christ to voters in next year's Academy Awards.

Gibson and his Icon Productions partner Bruce Davey said they would not be campaigning in print, radio or TV for success at the Oscars in February. "This film should be judged on its artistic merit, not who spends more money on advertising," Davey said. But DVDs will be sent to Oscar voters, who will be invited to screenings. Icon spent very little on advertising the film, which deals with the last hours of Jesus Christ's life, when it was released earlier this year - instead, it made the film available for special screenings at churches. It went on to gross over $600m (£322m) in ticket sales worldwide. Over recent years, marketing films to the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has become a multi-million dollar industry. Last year, the academy formed a committee to tighten the rules after the campaigns spilled over into personal attacks between studios. Academy president Frank Pierson praised Gibson's move for working to restore the Oscars as a "celebration and appreciation of excellence," and resisting the "crass commercialisation that was threatening the integrity of the award".

No UK premiere for Rings musical

The producers behind the Lord of the Rings musical have abandoned plans to premiere the show in London because no suitable theatre was available.

The £11.5m show will make its debut in Toronto in March 2006, after it was found that all three West End theatres with sufficient capacity were booked. The musical is not expected in London before December 2006. Producer Kevin Wallace said it would be "worth waiting for". "It will be like nothing they have ever seen before." "I know there will be a lot of disappointed British Tolkien fans who hoped to see the show in London, but we couldn't get a London theatre in time," added the British producer. The world premiere of the stage musical, co-produced by Canadian theatrical impresarios David and Ed Mirvish, will take place at Toronto's Princess of Wales Theatre next year.

A distributed system, also known as distributed computing, is a system with multiple components located on different machines that communicate and coordinate actions in order to appear as a single coherent system to the end-user.

Overview
The machines that are a part of a distributed system may be computers, physical servers, virtual machines, containers, or any other node that can connect to the network, have local memory, and communicate by passing messages.

There are two general ways that distributed systems function:

Each machine works toward a common goal and the end-user views results as one cohesive unit.
Each machine has its own end-user and the distributed system facilitates sharing resources or communication services.
Although distributed systems can sometimes be obscure, they usually have three primary characteristics: all components run concurrently, there is no global clock, and all components fail independently of each other.

Benefits and challenges of distributed systems
There are three reasons that teams generally decide to implement distributed systems:

Horizontal Scalability—Since computing happens independently on each node, it is easy and generally inexpensive to add additional nodes and functionality as necessary.
Reliability—Most distributed systems are fault-tolerant as they can be made up of hundreds of nodes that work together. The system generally doesn’t experience any disruptions if a single machine fails.
Performance—Distributed systems are extremely efficient because work loads can be broken up and sent to multiple machines.
However, distributed systems are not without challenges. Complex architectural design, construction, and debugging processes that are required to create an effective distributed system can be overwhelming.

>> import asyncio

>>> async def main():
...     print('hello')
...     await asyncio.sleep(1)
...     print('world')

>>> asyncio.run(main())
hello
world
Note that simply calling a coroutine will not schedule it to be executed:

>>>
>>> main()
<coroutine object main at 0x1053bb7c8>
To actually run a coroutine, asyncio provides three main mechanisms:

The asyncio.run() function to run the top-level entry point “main()” function (see the above example.)

Awaiting on a coroutine. The following snippet of code will print “hello” after waiting for 1 second, and then print “world” after waiting for another 2 seconds:

import asyncio
import time

async def say_after(delay, what):
    await asyncio.sleep(delay)
    print(what)

async def main():
    print(f"started at {time.strftime('%X')}")

    await say_after(1, 'hello')
    await say_after(2, 'world')

    print(f"finished at {time.strftime('%X')}")

asyncio.run(main())
Expected output:

started at 17:13:52
hello
world
finished at 17:13:55
The asyncio.create_task() function to run coroutines concurrently as asyncio Tasks.

Let’s modify the above example and run two say_after coroutines concurrently:

async def main():
    task1 = asyncio.create_task(
        say_after(1, 'hello'))

    task2 = asyncio.create_task(
        say_after(2, 'world'))

    print(f"started at {time.strftime('%X')}")

    # Wait until both tasks are completed (should take
    # around 2 seconds.)
    await task1
    await task2

    print(f"finished at {time.strftime('%X')}")
Note that expected output now shows that the snippet runs 1 second faster than before:

started at 17:14:32
hello
world
finished at 17:14:34
Awaitables
We say that an object is an awaitable object if it can be used in an await expression. Many asyncio APIs are designed to accept awaitables.

There are three main types of awaitable objects: coroutines, Tasks, and Futures.

Coroutines

Python coroutines are awaitables and therefore can be awaited from other coroutines:

import asyncio

async def nested():
    return 42

async def main():
    # Nothing happens if we just call "nested()".
    # A coroutine object is created but not awaited,
    # so it *won't run at all*.
    nested()

    # Let's do it differently now and await it:
    print(await nested())  # will print "42".

asyncio.run(main())
Important In this documentation the term “coroutine” can be used for two closely related concepts:
a coroutine function: an async def function;

a coroutine object: an object returned by calling a coroutine function.

asyncio also supports legacy generator-based coroutines.

Tasks

Tasks are used to schedule coroutines concurrently.

When a coroutine is wrapped into a Task with functions like asyncio.create_task() the coroutine is automatically scheduled to run soon:

import asyncio

async def nested():
    return 42

async def main():
    # Schedule nested() to run soon concurrently
    # with "main()".
    task = asyncio.create_task(nested())

    # "task" can now be used to cancel "nested()", or
    # can simply be awaited to wait until it is complete:
    await task

asyncio.run(main())
Futures

A Future is a special low-level awaitable object that represents an eventual result of an asynchronous operation.

When a Future object is awaited it means that the coroutine will wait until the Future is resolved in some other place.

Future objects in asyncio are needed to allow callback-based code to be used with async/await.

Normally there is no need to create Future objects at the application level code.

Future objects, sometimes exposed by libraries and some asyncio APIs, can be awaited:

async def main():
    await function_that_returns_a_future_object()

    # this is also valid:
    await asyncio.gather(
        function_that_returns_a_future_object(),
        some_python_coroutine()
    )
A good example of a low-level function that returns a Future object is loop.run_in_executor().

Running an asyncio Program
asyncio.run(coro, *, debug=False)
Execute the coroutine coro and return the result.

This function runs the passed coroutine, taking care of managing the asyncio event loop and finalizing asynchronous generators.

This function cannot be called when another asyncio event loop is running in the same thread.

If debug is True, the event loop will be run in debug mode.

This function always creates a new event loop and closes it at the end. It should be used as a main entry point for asyncio programs, and should ideally only be called once.

Example:

async def main():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print('hello')

asyncio.run(main())
New in version 3.7.

Note The source code for asyncio.run() can be found in Lib/asyncio/runners.py.
Creating Tasks
asyncio.create_task(coro, *, name=None)
Wrap the coro coroutine into a Task and schedule its execution. Return the Task object.

If name is not None, it is set as the name of the task using Task.set_name().

The task is executed in the loop returned by get_running_loop(), RuntimeError is raised if there is no running loop in current thread.

This function has been added in Python 3.7. Prior to Python 3.7, the low-level asyncio.ensure_future() function can be used instead:

async def coro():
    ...

# In Python 3.7+
task = asyncio.create_task(coro())
...

# This works in all Python versions but is less readable
task = asyncio.ensure_future(coro())
...
New in version 3.7.

Changed in version 3.8: Added the name parameter.

Sleeping
coroutine asyncio.sleep(delay, result=None, *, loop=None)
Block for delay seconds.

If result is provided, it is returned to the caller when the coroutine completes.

sleep() always suspends the current task, allowing other tasks to run.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example of coroutine displaying the current date every second for 5 seconds:

import asyncio
import datetime

async def display_date():
    loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
    end_time = loop.time() + 5.0
    while True:
        print(datetime.datetime.now())
        if (loop.time() + 1.0) >= end_time:
            break
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

asyncio.run(display_date())
Running Tasks Concurrently
awaitable asyncio.gather(*aws, loop=None, return_exceptions=False)
Run awaitable objects in the aws sequence concurrently.

If any awaitable in aws is a coroutine, it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

If all awaitables are completed successfully, the result is an aggregate list of returned values. The order of result values corresponds to the order of awaitables in aws.

If return_exceptions is False (default), the first raised exception is immediately propagated to the task that awaits on gather(). Other awaitables in the aws sequence won’t be cancelled and will continue to run.

If return_exceptions is True, exceptions are treated the same as successful results, and aggregated in the result list.

If gather() is cancelled, all submitted awaitables (that have not completed yet) are also cancelled.

If any Task or Future from the aws sequence is cancelled, it is treated as if it raised CancelledError – the gather() call is not cancelled in this case. This is to prevent the cancellation of one submitted Task/Future to cause other Tasks/Futures to be cancelled.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

import asyncio

async def factorial(name, number):
    f = 1
    for i in range(2, number + 1):
        print(f"Task {name}: Compute factorial({i})...")
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        f *= i
    print(f"Task {name}: factorial({number}) = {f}")

async def main():
    # Schedule three calls *concurrently*:
    await asyncio.gather(
        factorial("A", 2),
        factorial("B", 3),
        factorial("C", 4),
    )

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     Task A: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task B: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task C: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task A: factorial(2) = 2
#     Task B: Compute factorial(3)...
#     Task C: Compute factorial(3)...
#     Task B: factorial(3) = 6
#     Task C: Compute factorial(4)...
#     Task C: factorial(4) = 24
Changed in version 3.7: If the gather itself is cancelled, the cancellation is propagated regardless of return_exceptions.

Shielding From Cancellation
awaitable asyncio.shield(aw, *, loop=None)
Protect an awaitable object from being cancelled.

If aw is a coroutine it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

The statement:

res = await shield(something())
is equivalent to:

res = await something()
except that if the coroutine containing it is cancelled, the Task running in something() is not cancelled. From the point of view of something(), the cancellation did not happen. Although its caller is still cancelled, so the “await” expression still raises a CancelledError.

If something() is cancelled by other means (i.e. from within itself) that would also cancel shield().

If it is desired to completely ignore cancellation (not recommended) the shield() function should be combined with a try/except clause, as follows:

try:
    res = await shield(something())
except CancelledError:
    res = None
Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Timeouts
coroutine asyncio.wait_for(aw, timeout, *, loop=None)
Wait for the aw awaitable to complete with a timeout.

If aw is a coroutine it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

timeout can either be None or a float or int number of seconds to wait for. If timeout is None, block until the future completes.

If a timeout occurs, it cancels the task and raises asyncio.TimeoutError.

To avoid the task cancellation, wrap it in shield().

The function will wait until the future is actually cancelled, so the total wait time may exceed the timeout.

If the wait is cancelled, the future aw is also cancelled.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

async def eternity():
    # Sleep for one hour
    await asyncio.sleep(3600)
    print('yay!')

async def main():
    # Wait for at most 1 second
    try:
        await asyncio.wait_for(eternity(), timeout=1.0)
    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        print('timeout!')

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     timeout!
Changed in version 3.7: When aw is cancelled due to a timeout, wait_for waits for aw to be cancelled. Previously, it raised asyncio.TimeoutError immediately.

Waiting Primitives
coroutine asyncio.wait(aws, *, loop=None, timeout=None, return_when=ALL_COMPLETED)
Run awaitable objects in the aws set concurrently and block until the condition specified by return_when.

Returns two sets of Tasks/Futures: (done, pending).

Usage:

done, pending = await asyncio.wait(aws)
timeout (a float or int), if specified, can be used to control the maximum number of seconds to wait before returning.

Note that this function does not raise asyncio.TimeoutError. Futures or Tasks that aren’t done when the timeout occurs are simply returned in the second set.

return_when indicates when this function should return. It must be one of the following constants:

Constant

Description

FIRST_COMPLETED

The function will return when any future finishes or is cancelled.

FIRST_EXCEPTION

The function will return when any future finishes by raising an exception. If no future raises an exception then it is equivalent to ALL_COMPLETED.

ALL_COMPLETED

The function will return when all futures finish or are cancelled.

Unlike wait_for(), wait() does not cancel the futures when a timeout occurs.

Deprecated since version 3.8: If any awaitable in aws is a coroutine, it is automatically scheduled as a Task. Passing coroutines objects to wait() directly is deprecated as it leads to confusing behavior.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Note wait() schedules coroutines as Tasks automatically and later returns those implicitly created Task objects in (done, pending) sets. Therefore the following code won’t work as expected:
async def foo():
    return 42

coro = foo()
done, pending = await asyncio.wait({coro})

if coro in done:
    # This branch will never be run!
Here is how the above snippet can be fixed:

async def foo():
    return 42

task = asyncio.create_task(foo())
done, pending = await asyncio.wait({task})

if task in done:
    # Everything will work as expected now.
Deprecated since version 3.8: Passing coroutine objects to wait() directly is deprecated.

asyncio.as_completed(aws, *, loop=None, timeout=None)
Run awaitable objects in the aws set concurrently. Return an iterator of Future objects. Each Future object returned represents the earliest result from the set of the remaining awaitables.

Raises asyncio.TimeoutError if the timeout occurs before all Futures are done.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

for f in as_completed(aws):
    earliest_result = await f
    # ...
Scheduling From Other Threads
asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro, loop)
Submit a coroutine to the given event loop. Thread-safe.

Return a concurrent.futures.Future to wait for the result from another OS thread.

This function is meant to be called from a different OS thread than the one where the event loop is running. Example:

# Create a coroutine
coro = asyncio.sleep(1, result=3)

# Submit the coroutine to a given loop
future = asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro, loop)

# Wait for the result with an optional timeout argument
assert future.result(timeout) == 3
If an exception is raised in the coroutine, the returned Future will be notified. It can also be used to cancel the task in the event loop:

try:
    result = future.result(timeout)
except asyncio.TimeoutError:
    print('The coroutine took too long, cancelling the task...')
    future.cancel()
except Exception as exc:
    print(f'The coroutine raised an exception: {exc!r}')
else:
    print(f'The coroutine returned: {result!r}')
See the concurrency and multithreading section of the documentation.

Unlike other asyncio functions this function requires the loop argument to be passed explicitly.

New in version 3.5.1.

Introspection
asyncio.current_task(loop=None)
Return the currently running Task instance, or None if no task is running.

If loop is None get_running_loop() is used to get the current loop.

New in version 3.7.

asyncio.all_tasks(loop=None)
Return a set of not yet finished Task objects run by the loop.

If loop is None, get_running_loop() is used for getting current loop.

New in version 3.7.

Task Object
class asyncio.Task(coro, *, loop=None, name=None)
A Future-like object that runs a Python coroutine. Not thread-safe.

Tasks are used to run coroutines in event loops. If a coroutine awaits on a Future, the Task suspends the execution of the coroutine and waits for the completion of the Future. When the Future is done, the execution of the wrapped coroutine resumes.

Event loops use cooperative scheduling: an event loop runs one Task at a time. While a Task awaits for the completion of a Future, the event loop runs other Tasks, callbacks, or performs IO operations.

Use the high-level asyncio.create_task() function to create Tasks, or the low-level loop.create_task() or ensure_future() functions. Manual instantiation of Tasks is discouraged.

To cancel a running Task use the cancel() method. Calling it will cause the Task to throw a CancelledError exception into the wrapped coroutine. If a coroutine is awaiting on a Future object during cancellation, the Future object will be cancelled.

cancelled() can be used to check if the Task was cancelled. The method returns True if the wrapped coroutine did not suppress the CancelledError exception and was actually cancelled.

asyncio.Task inherits from Future all of its APIs except Future.set_result() and Future.set_exception().

Tasks support the contextvars module. When a Task is created it copies the current context and later runs its coroutine in the copied context.

Changed in version 3.7: Added support for the contextvars module.

Changed in version 3.8: Added the name parameter.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

cancel()
Request the Task to be cancelled.

This arranges for a CancelledError exception to be thrown into the wrapped coroutine on the next cycle of the event loop.

The coroutine then has a chance to clean up or even deny the request by suppressing the exception with a try … … except CancelledError … finally block. Therefore, unlike Future.cancel(), Task.cancel() does not guarantee that the Task will be cancelled, although suppressing cancellation completely is not common and is actively discouraged.

The following example illustrates how coroutines can intercept the cancellation request:

async def cancel_me():
    print('cancel_me(): before sleep')

    try:
        # Wait for 1 hour
        await asyncio.sleep(3600)
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print('cancel_me(): cancel sleep')
        raise
    finally:
        print('cancel_me(): after sleep')

async def main():
    # Create a "cancel_me" Task
    task = asyncio.create_task(cancel_me())

    # Wait for 1 second
    await asyncio.sleep(1)

    task.cancel()
    try:
        await task
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print("main(): cancel_me is cancelled now")

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     cancel_me(): before sleep
#     cancel_me(): cancel sleep
#     cancel_me(): after sleep
#     main(): cancel_me is cancelled now
cancelled()
Return True if the Task is cancelled.

The Task is cancelled when the cancellation was requested with cancel() and the wrapped coroutine propagated the CancelledError exception thrown into it.

done()
Return True if the Task is done.

A Task is done when the wrapped coroutine either returned a value, raised an exception, or the Task was cancelled.

result()
Return the result of the Task.

If the Task is done, the result of the wrapped coroutine is returned (or if the coroutine raised an exception, that exception is re-raised.)

If the Task has been cancelled, this method raises a CancelledError exception.

If the Task’s result isn’t yet available, this method raises a InvalidStateError exception.

exception()
Return the exception of the Task.

If the wrapped coroutine raised an exception that exception is returned. If the wrapped coroutine returned normally this method returns None.

If the Task has been cancelled, this method raises a CancelledError exception.

If the Task isn’t done yet, this method raises an InvalidStateError exception.

add_done_callback(callback, *, context=None)
Add a callback to be run when the Task is done.

This method should only be used in low-level callback-based code.

See the documentation of Future.add_done_callback() for more details.

remove_done_callback(callback)
Remove callback from the callbacks list.

This method should only be used in low-level callback-based code.

See the documentation of Future.remove_done_callback() for more details.

get_stack(*, limit=None)
Return the list of stack frames for this Task.

If the wrapped coroutine is not done, this returns the stack where it is suspended. If the coroutine has completed successfully or was cancelled, this returns an empty list. If the coroutine was terminated by an exception, this returns the list of traceback frames.

The frames are always ordered from oldest to newest.

Only one stack frame is returned for a suspended coroutine.

The optional limit argument sets the maximum number of frames to return; by default all available frames are returned. The ordering of the returned list differs depending on whether a stack or a traceback is returned: the newest frames of a stack are returned, but the oldest frames of a traceback are returned. (This matches the behavior of the traceback module.)

print_stack(*, limit=None, file=None)
Print the stack or traceback for this Task.

This produces output similar to that of the traceback module for the frames retrieved by get_stack().

The limit argument is passed to get_stack() directly.

The file argument is an I/O stream to which the output is written; by default output is written to sys.stderr.

get_coro()
Return the coroutine object wrapped by the Task.

New in version 3.8.

get_name()
Return the name of the Task.

If no name has been explicitly assigned to the Task, the default asyncio Task implementation generates a default name during instantiation.

New in version 3.8.

set_name(value)
Set the name of the Task.

The value argument can be any object, which is then converted to a string.

In the default Task implementation, the name will be visible in the repr() output of a task object.

New in version 3.8.

classmethod all_tasks(loop=None)
Return a set of all tasks for an event loop.

By default all tasks for the current event loop are returned. If loop is None, the get_event_loop() function is used to get the current loop.

Deprecated since version 3.7, will be removed in version 3.9: Do not call this as a task method. Use the asyncio.all_tasks() function instead.

classmethod current_task(loop=None)
Return the currently running task or None.

If loop is None, the get_event_loop() function is used to get the current loop.

Deprecated since version 3.7, will be removed in version 3.9: Do not call this as a task method. Use the asyncio.current_task() function instead.

Generator-based Coroutines
Note Support for generator-based coroutines is deprecated and is scheduled for removal in Python 3.10.
Generator-based coroutines predate async/await syntax. They are Python generators that use yield from expressions to await on Futures and other coroutines.

Generator-based coroutines should be decorated with @asyncio.coroutine, although this is not enforced.

@asyncio.coroutine
Decorator to mark generator-based coroutines.

This decorator enables legacy generator-based coroutines to be compatible with async/await code:

@asyncio.coroutine
def old_style_coroutine():
    yield from asyncio.sleep(1)

async def main():
    await old_style_coroutine()
This decorator should not be used for async def coroutines.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: Use async def instead.

asyncio.iscoroutine(obj)
Return True if obj is a coroutine object.

This method is different from inspect.iscoroutine() because it returns True for generator-based coroutines.

asyncio.iscoroutinefunction(func)
Return True if func is a coroutine function.

This method is different from inspect.iscoroutinefunction() because it returns True for generator-based coroutine functions decorated with @coroutine.

Three more challenges you may encounter include:

Scheduling—A distributed system has to decide which jobs need to run, when they should run, and where they should run. Schedulers ultimately have limitations, leading to underutilized hardware and unpredictable runtimes.
Latency—The more widely your system is distributed, the more latency you can experience with communications. This often leads to teams making tradeoffs between availability, consistency, and latency.
Observability—Gathering, processing, presenting, and monitoring hardware usage metrics for large clusters is a significant challenge.
How a Distributed System Works
Hardware and software architectures are used to maintain a distributed system. Everything must be interconnected—CPUs via the network and processes via the communication system.

Producer Mel Gibson will not be using paid advertisements to promote The Passion of the Christ to voters in next year's Academy Awards.

Gibson and his Icon Productions partner Bruce Davey said they would not be campaigning in print, radio or TV for success at the Oscars in February. "This film should be judged on its artistic merit, not who spends more money on advertising," Davey said. But DVDs will be sent to Oscar voters, who will be invited to screenings. Icon spent very little on advertising the film, which deals with the last hours of Jesus Christ's life, when it was released earlier this year - instead, it made the film available for special screenings at churches. It went on to gross over $600m (£322m) in ticket sales worldwide. Over recent years, marketing films to the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has become a multi-million dollar industry. Last year, the academy formed a committee to tighten the rules after the campaigns spilled over into personal attacks between studios. Academy president Frank Pierson praised Gibson's move for working to restore the Oscars as a "celebration and appreciation of excellence," and resisting the "crass commercialisation that was threatening the integrity of the award".

No UK premiere for Rings musical

The producers behind the Lord of the Rings musical have abandoned plans to premiere the show in London because no suitable theatre was available.

The £11.5m show will make its debut in Toronto in March 2006, after it was found that all three West End theatres with sufficient capacity were booked. The musical is not expected in London before December 2006. Producer Kevin Wallace said it would be "worth waiting for". "It will be like nothing they have ever seen before." "I know there will be a lot of disappointed British Tolkien fans who hoped to see the show in London, but we couldn't get a London theatre in time," added the British producer. The world premiere of the stage musical, co-produced by Canadian theatrical impresarios David and Ed Mirvish, will take place at Toronto's Princess of Wales Theatre next year.

"Toronto really wanted this premiere. The Tolkien books and films are hugely popular in Canada," said Mr Wallace, shortly after signing the deal in Canada. "We hope the anticipation and excitement over here will create an even bigger buzz by the time we open in London." Auditions begin in Canada on Thursday, but up to five British actors may join the cast, under a deal struck with Canadian Actors' Equity. The music for the show is being written by Bollywood composer AR Rahman, who was behind Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End musical Bollywood Dreams, and in conjuction with the Finnish group Varttina.

"There will be no singing and dancing Hobbits. The music will be in a very traditional mould and draw on ethnic traditions," assured Mr Wallace. The musical's British director is Matthew Warchus, best known for staging the worldwide stage hit Art. "The production will be a hybrid of text, physical theatre, music and spectacle never previously seen on this scale," he said. "Only in the theatre are we actually plunged into the events as they happen. The environment surrounds us and we are in Middle Earth." New Zealander Peter Jackson took 10 years to bring JRR Tolkien's fantasy trilogy to the big screen, winning Academy Awards for best film and best director for the final film The Return of the King in 2004.

"There will be no singing and dancing Hobbits. The music will be in a very traditional mould and draw on ethnic traditions," assured Mr Wallace. The musical's British director is Matthew Warchus, best known for staging the worldwide stage hit Art. "The production will be a hybrid of text, physical theatre, music and spectacle never previously seen on this scale," he said. "Only in the theatre are we actually plunged into the events as they happen. The environment surrounds us and we are in Middle Earth." New Zealander Peter Jackson took 10 years to bring JRR Tolkien's fantasy trilogy to the big screen, winning Academy Awards for best film and best director for the final film The Return of the King in 2004.
No ads for Passion Oscar campaign

Producer Mel Gibson will not be using paid advertisements to promote The Passion of the Christ to voters in next year's Academy Awards.

Gibson and his Icon Productions partner Bruce Davey said they would not be campaigning in print, radio or TV for success at the Oscars in February. "This film should be judged on its artistic merit, not who spends more money on advertising," Davey said. But DVDs will be sent to Oscar voters, who will be invited to screenings. Icon spent very little on advertising the film, which deals with the last hours of Jesus Christ's life, when it was released earlier this year - instead, it made the film available for special screenings at churches. It went on to gross over $600m (£322m) in ticket sales worldwide. Over recent years, marketing films to the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has become a multi-million dollar industry. Last year, the academy formed a committee to tighten the rules after the campaigns spilled over into personal attacks between studios. Academy president Frank Pierson praised Gibson's move for working to restore the Oscars as a "celebration and appreciation of excellence," and resisting the "crass commercialisation that was threatening the integrity of the award".

No UK premiere for Rings musical

The producers behind the Lord of the Rings musical have abandoned plans to premiere the show in London because no suitable theatre was available.

The £11.5m show will make its debut in Toronto in March 2006, after it was found that all three West End theatres with sufficient capacity were booked. The musical is not expected in London before December 2006. Producer Kevin Wallace said it would be "worth waiting for". "It will be like nothing they have ever seen before." "I know there will be a lot of disappointed British Tolkien fans who hoped to see the show in London, but we couldn't get a London theatre in time," added the British producer. The world premiere of the stage musical, co-produced by Canadian theatrical impresarios David and Ed Mirvish, will take place at Toronto's Princess of Wales Theatre next year.

"Toronto really wanted this premiere. The Tolkien books and films are hugely popular in Canada," said Mr Wallace, shortly after signing the deal in Canada. "We hope the anticipation and excitement over here will create an even bigger buzz by the time we open in London." Auditions begin in Canada on Thursday, but up to five British actors may join the cast, under a deal struck with Canadian Actors' Equity. The music for the show is being written by Bollywood composer AR Rahman, who was behind Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End musical Bollywood Dreams, and in conjuction with the Finnish group Varttina.

The asyncio.run() function to run the top-level entry point “main()” function (see the above example.)

Awaiting on a coroutine. The following snippet of code will print “hello” after waiting for 1 second, and then print “world” after waiting for another 2 seconds:

import asyncio
import time

async def say_after(delay, what):
    await asyncio.sleep(delay)
    print(what)

async def main():
    print(f"started at {time.strftime('%X')}")

    await say_after(1, 'hello')
    await say_after(2, 'world')

    print(f"finished at {time.strftime('%X')}")

asyncio.run(main())
Expected output:

started at 17:13:52
hello
world
finished at 17:13:55
The asyncio.create_task() function to run coroutines concurrently as asyncio Tasks.

Let’s modify the above example and run two say_after coroutines concurrently:

async def main():
    task1 = asyncio.create_task(
        say_after(1, 'hello'))

    task2 = asyncio.create_task(
        say_after(2, 'world'))

    print(f"started at {time.strftime('%X')}")

    # Wait until both tasks are completed (should take
    # around 2 seconds.)
    await task1
    await task2

    print(f"finished at {time.strftime('%X')}")
Note that expected output now shows that the snippet runs 1 second faster than before:

started at 17:14:32
hello
world
finished at 17:14:34
Awaitables
We say that an object is an awaitable object if it can be used in an await expression. Many asyncio APIs are designed to accept awaitables.

There are three main types of awaitable objects: coroutines, Tasks, and Futures.

Coroutines

Python coroutines are awaitables and therefore can be awaited from other coroutines:

import asyncio

async def nested():
    return 42

async def main():
    # Nothing happens if we just call "nested()".
    # A coroutine object is created but not awaited,
    # so it *won't run at all*.
    nested()

    # Let's do it differently now and await it:
    print(await nested())  # will print "42".

asyncio.run(main())
Important In this documentation the term “coroutine” can be used for two closely related concepts:
a coroutine function: an async def function;

a coroutine object: an object returned by calling a coroutine function.

asyncio also supports legacy generator-based coroutines.

Tasks

Tasks are used to schedule coroutines concurrently.

When a coroutine is wrapped into a Task with functions like asyncio.create_task() the coroutine is automatically scheduled to run soon:

import asyncio

async def nested():
    return 42

async def main():
    # Schedule nested() to run soon concurrently
    # with "main()".
    task = asyncio.create_task(nested())

    # "task" can now be used to cancel "nested()", or
    # can simply be awaited to wait until it is complete:
    await task

asyncio.run(main())
Futures

A Future is a special low-level awaitable object that represents an eventual result of an asynchronous operation.

When a Future object is awaited it means that the coroutine will wait until the Future is resolved in some other place.

Future objects in asyncio are needed to allow callback-based code to be used with async/await.

Normally there is no need to create Future objects at the application level code.

Future objects, sometimes exposed by libraries and some asyncio APIs, can be awaited:

async def main():
    await function_that_returns_a_future_object()

    # this is also valid:
    await asyncio.gather(
        function_that_returns_a_future_object(),
        some_python_coroutine()
    )
A good example of a low-level function that returns a Future object is loop.run_in_executor().

Running an asyncio Program
asyncio.run(coro, *, debug=False)
Execute the coroutine coro and return the result.

This function runs the passed coroutine, taking care of managing the asyncio event loop and finalizing asynchronous generators.

This function cannot be called when another asyncio event loop is running in the same thread.

If debug is True, the event loop will be run in debug mode.

This function always creates a new event loop and closes it at the end. It should be used as a main entry point for asyncio programs, and should ideally only be called once.

Example:

async def main():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print('hello')

asyncio.run(main())
New in version 3.7.

Note The source code for asyncio.run() can be found in Lib/asyncio/runners.py.
Creating Tasks
asyncio.create_task(coro, *, name=None)
Wrap the coro coroutine into a Task and schedule its execution. Return the Task object.

If name is not None, it is set as the name of the task using Task.set_name().

The task is executed in the loop returned by get_running_loop(), RuntimeError is raised if there is no running loop in current thread.

This function has been added in Python 3.7. Prior to Python 3.7, the low-level asyncio.ensure_future() function can be used instead:

async def coro():
    ...

# In Python 3.7+
task = asyncio.create_task(coro())
...

# This works in all Python versions but is less readable
task = asyncio.ensure_future(coro())
...
New in version 3.7.

Changed in version 3.8: Added the name parameter.

Sleeping
coroutine asyncio.sleep(delay, result=None, *, loop=None)
Block for delay seconds.

If result is provided, it is returned to the caller when the coroutine completes.

sleep() always suspends the current task, allowing other tasks to run.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example of coroutine displaying the current date every second for 5 seconds:

import asyncio
import datetime

async def display_date():
    loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
    end_time = loop.time() + 5.0
    while True:
        print(datetime.datetime.now())
        if (loop.time() + 1.0) >= end_time:
            break
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

asyncio.run(display_date())
Running Tasks Concurrently
awaitable asyncio.gather(*aws, loop=None, return_exceptions=False)
Run awaitable objects in the aws sequence concurrently.

If any awaitable in aws is a coroutine, it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

If all awaitables are completed successfully, the result is an aggregate list of returned values. The order of result values corresponds to the order of awaitables in aws.

If return_exceptions is False (default), the first raised exception is immediately propagated to the task that awaits on gather(). Other awaitables in the aws sequence won’t be cancelled and will continue to run.

If return_exceptions is True, exceptions are treated the same as successful results, and aggregated in the result list.

If gather() is cancelled, all submitted awaitables (that have not completed yet) are also cancelled.

If any Task or Future from the aws sequence is cancelled, it is treated as if it raised CancelledError – the gather() call is not cancelled in this case. This is to prevent the cancellation of one submitted Task/Future to cause other Tasks/Futures to be cancelled.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

import asyncio

async def factorial(name, number):
    f = 1
    for i in range(2, number + 1):
        print(f"Task {name}: Compute factorial({i})...")
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        f *= i
    print(f"Task {name}: factorial({number}) = {f}")

async def main():
    # Schedule three calls *concurrently*:
    await asyncio.gather(
        factorial("A", 2),
        factorial("B", 3),
        factorial("C", 4),
    )

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     Task A: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task B: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task C: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task A: factorial(2) = 2
#     Task B: Compute factorial(3)...
#     Task C: Compute factorial(3)...
#     Task B: factorial(3) = 6
#     Task C: Compute factorial(4)...
#     Task C: factorial(4) = 24
Changed in version 3.7: If the gather itself is cancelled, the cancellation is propagated regardless of return_exceptions.

Shielding From Cancellation
awaitable asyncio.shield(aw, *, loop=None)
Protect an awaitable object from being cancelled.

If aw is a coroutine it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

The statement:

res = await shield(something())
is equivalent to:

res = await something()
except that if the coroutine containing it is cancelled, the Task running in something() is not cancelled. From the point of view of something(), the cancellation did not happen. Although its caller is still cancelled, so the “await” expression still raises a CancelledError.

If something() is cancelled by other means (i.e. from within itself) that would also cancel shield().

If it is desired to completely ignore cancellation (not recommended) the shield() function should be combined with a try/except clause, as follows:

try:
    res = await shield(something())
except CancelledError:
    res = None
Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Timeouts
coroutine asyncio.wait_for(aw, timeout, *, loop=None)
Wait for the aw awaitable to complete with a timeout.

If aw is a coroutine it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

timeout can either be None or a float or int number of seconds to wait for. If timeout is None, block until the future completes.

If a timeout occurs, it cancels the task and raises asyncio.TimeoutError.

To avoid the task cancellation, wrap it in shield().

The function will wait until the future is actually cancelled, so the total wait time may exceed the timeout.

If the wait is cancelled, the future aw is also cancelled.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

async def eternity():
    # Sleep for one hour
    await asyncio.sleep(3600)
    print('yay!')

async def main():
    # Wait for at most 1 second
    try:
        await asyncio.wait_for(eternity(), timeout=1.0)
    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        print('timeout!')

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     timeout!
Changed in version 3.7: When aw is cancelled due to a timeout, wait_for waits for aw to be cancelled. Previously, it raised asyncio.TimeoutError immediately.

Waiting Primitives
coroutine asyncio.wait(aws, *, loop=None, timeout=None, return_when=ALL_COMPLETED)
Run awaitable objects in the aws set concurrently and block until the condition specified by return_when.

Returns two sets of Tasks/Futures: (done, pending).

Usage:

done, pending = await asyncio.wait(aws)
timeout (a float or int), if specified, can be used to control the maximum number of seconds to wait before returning.

Note that this function does not raise asyncio.TimeoutError. Futures or Tasks that aren’t done when the timeout occurs are simply returned in the second set.

return_when indicates when this function should return. It must be one of the following constants:

Constant

Description

FIRST_COMPLETED

The function will return when any future finishes or is cancelled.

FIRST_EXCEPTION

The function will return when any future finishes by raising an exception. If no future raises an exception then it is equivalent to ALL_COMPLETED.

ALL_COMPLETED

The function will return when all futures finish or are cancelled.

Unlike wait_for(), wait() does not cancel the futures when a timeout occurs.

Deprecated since version 3.8: If any awaitable in aws is a coroutine, it is automatically scheduled as a Task. Passing coroutines objects to wait() directly is deprecated as it leads to confusing behavior.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Note wait() schedules coroutines as Tasks automatically and later returns those implicitly created Task objects in (done, pending) sets. Therefore the following code won’t work as expected:
async def foo():
    return 42

coro = foo()
done, pending = await asyncio.wait({coro})

if coro in done:
    # This branch will never be run!
Here is how the above snippet can be fixed:

async def foo():
    return 42

task = asyncio.create_task(foo())
done, pending = await asyncio.wait({task})

if task in done:
    # Everything will work as expected now.
Deprecated since version 3.8: Passing coroutine objects to wait() directly is deprecated.

asyncio.as_completed(aws, *, loop=None, timeout=None)
Run awaitable objects in the aws set concurrently. Return an iterator of Future objects. Each Future object returned represents the earliest result from the set of the remaining awaitables.

Raises asyncio.TimeoutError if the timeout occurs before all Futures are done.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

for f in as_completed(aws):
    earliest_result = await f
    # ...
Scheduling From Other Threads
asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro, loop)
Submit a coroutine to the given event loop. Thread-safe.

Return a concurrent.futures.Future to wait for the result from another OS thread.

This function is meant to be called from a different OS thread than the one where the event loop is running. Example:

# Create a coroutine
coro = asyncio.sleep(1, result=3)

# Submit the coroutine to a given loop
future = asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro, loop)

# Wait for the result with an optional timeout argument
assert future.result(timeout) == 3
If an exception is raised in the coroutine, the returned Future will be notified. It can also be used to cancel the task in the event loop:

try:
    result = future.result(timeout)
except asyncio.TimeoutError:
    print('The coroutine took too long, cancelling the task...')
    future.cancel()
except Exception as exc:
    print(f'The coroutine raised an exception: {exc!r}')
else:
    print(f'The coroutine returned: {result!r}')
See the concurrency and multithreading section of the documentation.

Unlike other asyncio functions this function requires the loop argument to be passed explicitly.

New in version 3.5.1.

Introspection
asyncio.current_task(loop=None)
Return the currently running Task instance, or None if no task is running.

If loop is None get_running_loop() is used to get the current loop.

New in version 3.7.

asyncio.all_tasks(loop=None)
Return a set of not yet finished Task objects run by the loop.

If loop is None, get_running_loop() is used for getting current loop.

New in version 3.7.

Task Object
class asyncio.Task(coro, *, loop=None, name=None)
A Future-like object that runs a Python coroutine. Not thread-safe.

Tasks are used to run coroutines in event loops. If a coroutine awaits on a Future, the Task suspends the execution of the coroutine and waits for the completion of the Future. When the Future is done, the execution of the wrapped coroutine resumes.

Event loops use cooperative scheduling: an event loop runs one Task at a time. While a Task awaits for the completion of a Future, the event loop runs other Tasks, callbacks, or performs IO operations.

Use the high-level asyncio.create_task() function to create Tasks, or the low-level loop.create_task() or ensure_future() functions. Manual instantiation of Tasks is discouraged.

To cancel a running Task use the cancel() method. Calling it will cause the Task to throw a CancelledError exception into the wrapped coroutine. If a coroutine is awaiting on a Future object during cancellation, the Future object will be cancelled.

cancelled() can be used to check if the Task was cancelled. The method returns True if the wrapped coroutine did not suppress the CancelledError exception and was actually cancelled.

asyncio.Task inherits from Future all of its APIs except Future.set_result() and Future.set_exception().

Tasks support the contextvars module. When a Task is created it copies the current context and later runs its coroutine in the copied context.

Changed in version 3.7: Added support for the contextvars module.

Changed in version 3.8: Added the name parameter.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

cancel()
Request the Task to be cancelled.

This arranges for a CancelledError exception to be thrown into the wrapped coroutine on the next cycle of the event loop.

The coroutine then has a chance to clean up or even deny the request by suppressing the exception with a try … … except CancelledError … finally block. Therefore, unlike Future.cancel(), Task.cancel() does not guarantee that the Task will be cancelled, although suppressing cancellation completely is not common and is actively discouraged.

The following example illustrates how coroutines can intercept the cancellation request:

async def cancel_me():
    print('cancel_me(): before sleep')

    try:
        # Wait for 1 hour
        await asyncio.sleep(3600)
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print('cancel_me(): cancel sleep')
        raise
    finally:
        print('cancel_me(): after sleep')

async def main():
    # Create a "cancel_me" Task
    task = asyncio.create_task(cancel_me())

    # Wait for 1 second
    await asyncio.sleep(1)

    task.cancel()
    try:
        await task
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print("main(): cancel_me is cancelled now")

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     cancel_me(): before sleep
#     cancel_me(): cancel sleep
#     cancel_me(): after sleep
#     main(): cancel_me is cancelled now
cancelled()
Return True if the Task is cancelled.

The Task is cancelled when the cancellation was requested with cancel() and the wrapped coroutine propagated the CancelledError exception thrown into it.

done()
Return True if the Task is done.

A Task is done when the wrapped coroutine either returned a value, raised an exception, or the Task was cancelled.

result()
Return the result of the Task.

If the Task is done, the result of the wrapped coroutine is returned (or if the coroutine raised an exception, that exception is re-raised.)

If the Task has been cancelled, this method raises a CancelledError exception.

If the Task’s result isn’t yet available, this method raises a InvalidStateError exception.

exception()
Return the exception of the Task.

If the wrapped coroutine raised an exception that exception is returned. If the wrapped coroutine returned normally this method returns None.

If the Task has been cancelled, this method raises a CancelledError exception.

If the Task isn’t done yet, this method raises an InvalidStateError exception.

add_done_callback(callback, *, context=None)
Add a callback to be run when the Task is done.

This method should only be used in low-level callback-based code.

See the documentation of Future.add_done_callback() for more details.

remove_done_callback(callback)
Remove callback from the callbacks list.

This method should only be used in low-level callback-based code.

See the documentation of Future.remove_done_callback() for more details.

get_stack(*, limit=None)
Return the list of stack frames for this Task.

If the wrapped coroutine is not done, this returns the stack where it is suspended. If the coroutine has completed successfully or was cancelled, this returns an empty list. If the coroutine was terminated by an exception, this returns the list of traceback frames.

The frames are always ordered from oldest to newest.

Only one stack frame is returned for a suspended coroutine.

The optional limit argument sets the maximum number of frames to return; by default all available frames are returned. The ordering of the returned list differs depending on whether a stack or a traceback is returned: the newest frames of a stack are returned, but the oldest frames of a traceback are returned. (This matches the behavior of the traceback module.)

print_stack(*, limit=None, file=None)
Print the stack or traceback for this Task.

This produces output similar to that of the traceback module for the frames retrieved by get_stack().

The limit argument is passed to get_stack() directly.

The file argument is an I/O stream to which the output is written; by default output is written to sys.stderr.

get_coro()
Return the coroutine object wrapped by the Task.

New in version 3.8.

get_name()
Return the name of the Task.

If no name has been explicitly assigned to the Task, the default asyncio Task implementation generates a default name during instantiation.

New in version 3.8.

set_name(value)
Set the name of the Task.

The value argument can be any object, which is then converted to a string.

In the default Task implementation, the name will be visible in the repr() output of a task object.

New in version 3.8.

classmethod all_tasks(loop=None)
Return a set of all tasks for an event loop.

By default all tasks for the current event loop are returned. If loop is None, the get_event_loop() function is used to get the current loop.

Deprecated since version 3.7, will be removed in version 3.9: Do not call this as a task method. Use the asyncio.all_tasks() function instead.

classmethod current_task(loop=None)
Return the currently running task or None.

If loop is None, the get_event_loop() function is used to get the current loop.

Deprecated since version 3.7, will be removed in version 3.9: Do not call this as a task method. Use the asyncio.current_task() function instead.

Generator-based Coroutines
Note Support for generator-based coroutines is deprecated and is scheduled for removal in Python 3.10.
Generator-based coroutines predate async/await syntax. They are Python generators that use yield from expressions to await on Futures and other coroutines.

Generator-based coroutines should be decorated with @asyncio.coroutine, although this is not enforced.

@asyncio.coroutine
Decorator to mark generator-based coroutines.

This decorator enables legacy generator-based coroutines to be compatible with async/await code:

@asyncio.coroutine
def old_style_coroutine():
    yield from asyncio.sleep(1)

async def main():
    await old_style_coroutine()
This decorator should not be used for async def coroutines.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: Use async def instead.

asyncio.iscoroutine(obj)
Return True if obj is a coroutine object.

This method is different from inspect.iscoroutine() because it returns True for generator-based coroutines.

asyncio.iscoroutinefunction(func)
Return True if func is a coroutine function.

This method is different from inspect.iscoroutinefunction() because it returns True for generator-based coroutine functions decorated with @coroutine.

No UK premiere for Rings musical

The producers behind the Lord of the Rings musical have abandoned plans to premiere the show in London because no suitable theatre was available.

The £11.5m show will make its debut in Toronto in March 2006, after it was found that all three West End theatres with sufficient capacity were booked. The musical is not expected in London before December 2006. Producer Kevin Wallace said it would be "worth waiting for". "It will be like nothing they have ever seen before." "I know there will be a lot of disappointed British Tolkien fans who hoped to see the show in London, but we couldn't get a London theatre in time," added the British producer. The world premiere of the stage musical, co-produced by Canadian theatrical impresarios David and Ed Mirvish, will take place at Toronto's Princess of Wales Theatre next year.

"Toronto really wanted this premiere. The Tolkien books and films are hugely popular in Canada," said Mr Wallace, shortly after signing the deal in Canada. "We hope the anticipation and excitement over here will create an even bigger buzz by the time we open in London." Auditions begin in Canada on Thursday, but up to five British actors may join the cast, under a deal struck with Canadian Actors' Equity. The music for the show is being written by Bollywood composer AR Rahman, who was behind Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End musical Bollywood Dreams, and in conjuction with the Finnish group Varttina.

"There will be no singing and dancing Hobbits. The music will be in a very traditional mould and draw on ethnic traditions," assured Mr Wallace. The musical's British director is Matthew Warchus, best known for staging the worldwide stage hit Art. "The production will be a hybrid of text, physical theatre, music and spectacle never previously seen on this scale," he said. "Only in the theatre are we actually plunged into the events as they happen. The environment surrounds us and we are in Middle Earth." New Zealander Peter Jackson took 10 years to bring JRR Tolkien's fantasy trilogy to the big screen, winning Academy Awards for best film and best director for the final film The Return of the King in 2004.
No ads for Passion Oscar campaign

Producer Mel Gibson will not be using paid advertisements to promote The Passion of the Christ to voters in next year's Academy Awards.

Gibson and his Icon Productions partner Bruce Davey said they would not be campaigning in print, radio or TV for success at the Oscars in February. "This film should be judged on its artistic merit, not who spends more money on advertising," Davey said. But DVDs will be sent to Oscar voters, who will be invited to screenings. Icon spent very little on advertising the film, which deals with the last hours of Jesus Christ's life, when it was released earlier this year - instead, it made the film available for special screenings at churches. It went on to gross over $600m (£322m) in ticket sales worldwide. Over recent years, marketing films to the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has become a multi-million dollar industry. Last year, the academy formed a committee to tighten the rules after the campaigns spilled over into personal attacks between studios. Academy president Frank Pierson praised Gibson's move for working to restore the Oscars as a "celebration and appreciation of excellence," and resisting the "crass commercialisation that was threatening the integrity of the award".

Academy president Frank Pierson praised Gibson's move for working to restore the Oscars as a "celebration and appreciation of excellence," and resisting the "crass commercialisation that was threatening the integrity of the award".

No UK premiere for Rings musical

The producers behind the Lord of the Rings musical have abandoned plans to premiere the show in London because no suitable theatre was available.

The £11.5m show will make its debut in Toronto in March 2006, after it was found that all three West End theatres with sufficient capacity were booked. The musical is not expected in London before December 2006. Producer Kevin Wallace said it would be "worth waiting for". "It will be like nothing they have ever seen before." "I know there will be a lot of disappointed British Tolkien fans who hoped to see the show in London, but we couldn't get a London theatre in time," added the British producer. The world premiere of the stage musical, co-produced by Canadian theatrical impresarios David and Ed Mirvish, will take place at Toronto's Princess of Wales Theatre next year.

"Toronto really wanted this premiere. The Tolkien books and films are hugely popular in Canada," said Mr Wallace, shortly after signing the deal in Canada. "We hope the anticipation and excitement over here will create an even bigger buzz by the time we open in London." Auditions begin in Canada on Thursday, but up to five British actors may join the cast, under a deal struck with Canadian Actors' Equity. The music for the show is being written by Bollywood composer AR Rahman, who was behind Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End musical Bollywood Dreams, and in conjuction with the Finnish group Varttina.

"There will be no singing and dancing Hobbits. The music will be in a very traditional mould and draw on ethnic traditions," assured Mr Wallace. The musical's British director is Matthew Warchus, best known for staging the worldwide stage hit Art. "The production will be a hybrid of text, physical theatre, music and spectacle never previously seen on this scale," he said. "Only in the theatre are we actually plunged into the events as they happen. The environment surrounds us and we are in Middle Earth." New Zealander Peter Jackson took 10 years to bring JRR Tolkien's fantasy trilogy to the big screen, winning Academy Awards for best film and best director for the final film The Return of the King in 2004.
No ads for Passion Oscar campaign

Producer Mel Gibson will not be using paid advertisements to promote The Passion of the Christ to voters in next year's Academy Awards.

Gibson and his Icon Productions partner Bruce Davey said they would not be campaigning in print, radio or TV for success at the Oscars in February. "This film should be judged on its artistic merit, not who spends more money on advertising," Davey said. But DVDs will be sent to Oscar voters, who will be invited to screenings. Icon spent very little on advertising the film, which deals with the last hours of Jesus Christ's life, when it was released earlier this year - instead, it made the film available for special screenings at churches. It went on to gross over $600m (£322m) in ticket sales worldwide.

A distributed system, also known as distributed computing, is a system with multiple components located on different machines that communicate and coordinate actions in order to appear as a single coherent system to the end-user.

Overview
The machines that are a part of a distributed system may be computers, physical servers, virtual machines, containers, or any other node that can connect to the network, have local memory, and communicate by passing messages.

There are two general ways that distributed systems function:

Each machine works toward a common goal and the end-user views results as one cohesive unit.
Each machine has its own end-user and the distributed system facilitates sharing resources or communication services.
Although distributed systems can sometimes be obscure, they usually have three primary characteristics: all components run concurrently, there is no global clock, and all components fail independently of each other.

Benefits and challenges of distributed systems
There are three reasons that teams generally decide to implement distributed systems:

Horizontal Scalability—Since computing happens independently on each node, it is easy and generally inexpensive to add additional nodes and functionality as necessary.
Reliability—Most distributed systems are fault-tolerant as they can be made up of hundreds of nodes that work together. The system generally doesn’t experience any disruptions if a single machine fails.
Performance—Distributed systems are extremely efficient because work loads can be broken up and sent to multiple machines.
However, distributed systems are not without challenges. Complex architectural design, construction, and debugging processes that are required to create an effective distributed system can be overwhelming.

>> import asyncio

>>> async def main():
...     print('hello')
...     await asyncio.sleep(1)
...     print('world')

>>> asyncio.run(main())
hello
world
Note that simply calling a coroutine will not schedule it to be executed:

>>>
>>> main()
<coroutine object main at 0x1053bb7c8>
To actually run a coroutine, asyncio provides three main mechanisms:

The asyncio.run() function to run the top-level entry point “main()” function (see the above example.)

Awaiting on a coroutine. The following snippet of code will print “hello” after waiting for 1 second, and then print “world” after waiting for another 2 seconds:

import asyncio
import time

async def say_after(delay, what):
    await asyncio.sleep(delay)
    print(what)

async def main():
    print(f"started at {time.strftime('%X')}")

    await say_after(1, 'hello')
    await say_after(2, 'world')

    print(f"finished at {time.strftime('%X')}")

asyncio.run(main())
Expected output:

started at 17:13:52
hello
world
finished at 17:13:55
The asyncio.create_task() function to run coroutines concurrently as asyncio Tasks.

Let’s modify the above example and run two say_after coroutines concurrently:

async def main():
    task1 = asyncio.create_task(
        say_after(1, 'hello'))

    task2 = asyncio.create_task(
        say_after(2, 'world'))

    print(f"started at {time.strftime('%X')}")

    # Wait until both tasks are completed (should take
    # around 2 seconds.)
    await task1
    await task2

    print(f"finished at {time.strftime('%X')}")
Note that expected output now shows that the snippet runs 1 second faster than before:

started at 17:14:32
hello
world
finished at 17:14:34
Awaitables
We say that an object is an awaitable object if it can be used in an await expression. Many asyncio APIs are designed to accept awaitables.

There are three main types of awaitable objects: coroutines, Tasks, and Futures.

Coroutines

Python coroutines are awaitables and therefore can be awaited from other coroutines:

import asyncio

async def nested():
    return 42

async def main():
    # Nothing happens if we just call "nested()".
    # A coroutine object is created but not awaited,
    # so it *won't run at all*.
    nested()

    # Let's do it differently now and await it:
    print(await nested())  # will print "42".

asyncio.run(main())
Important In this documentation the term “coroutine” can be used for two closely related concepts:
a coroutine function: an async def function;

a coroutine object: an object returned by calling a coroutine function.

asyncio also supports legacy generator-based coroutines.

Tasks

Tasks are used to schedule coroutines concurrently.

When a coroutine is wrapped into a Task with functions like asyncio.create_task() the coroutine is automatically scheduled to run soon:

import asyncio

async def nested():
    return 42

async def main():
    # Schedule nested() to run soon concurrently
    # with "main()".
    task = asyncio.create_task(nested())

    # "task" can now be used to cancel "nested()", or
    # can simply be awaited to wait until it is complete:
    await task

asyncio.run(main())
Futures

A Future is a special low-level awaitable object that represents an eventual result of an asynchronous operation.

When a Future object is awaited it means that the coroutine will wait until the Future is resolved in some other place.

Future objects in asyncio are needed to allow callback-based code to be used with async/await.

Normally there is no need to create Future objects at the application level code.

Future objects, sometimes exposed by libraries and some asyncio APIs, can be awaited:

async def main():
    await function_that_returns_a_future_object()

    # this is also valid:
    await asyncio.gather(
        function_that_returns_a_future_object(),
        some_python_coroutine()
    )
A good example of a low-level function that returns a Future object is loop.run_in_executor().

Running an asyncio Program
asyncio.run(coro, *, debug=False)
Execute the coroutine coro and return the result.

This function runs the passed coroutine, taking care of managing the asyncio event loop and finalizing asynchronous generators.

This function cannot be called when another asyncio event loop is running in the same thread.

If debug is True, the event loop will be run in debug mode.

This function always creates a new event loop and closes it at the end. It should be used as a main entry point for asyncio programs, and should ideally only be called once.

Example:

async def main():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print('hello')

asyncio.run(main())
New in version 3.7.

Note The source code for asyncio.run() can be found in Lib/asyncio/runners.py.
Creating Tasks
asyncio.create_task(coro, *, name=None)
Wrap the coro coroutine into a Task and schedule its execution. Return the Task object.

If name is not None, it is set as the name of the task using Task.set_name().

The task is executed in the loop returned by get_running_loop(), RuntimeError is raised if there is no running loop in current thread.

This function has been added in Python 3.7. Prior to Python 3.7, the low-level asyncio.ensure_future() function can be used instead:

async def coro():
    ...

# In Python 3.7+
task = asyncio.create_task(coro())
...

# This works in all Python versions but is less readable
task = asyncio.ensure_future(coro())
...
New in version 3.7.

Changed in version 3.8: Added the name parameter.

Sleeping
coroutine asyncio.sleep(delay, result=None, *, loop=None)
Block for delay seconds.

If result is provided, it is returned to the caller when the coroutine completes.

sleep() always suspends the current task, allowing other tasks to run.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example of coroutine displaying the current date every second for 5 seconds:

import asyncio
import datetime

async def display_date():
    loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
    end_time = loop.time() + 5.0
    while True:
        print(datetime.datetime.now())
        if (loop.time() + 1.0) >= end_time:
            break
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

asyncio.run(display_date())
Running Tasks Concurrently
awaitable asyncio.gather(*aws, loop=None, return_exceptions=False)
Run awaitable objects in the aws sequence concurrently.

If any awaitable in aws is a coroutine, it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

If all awaitables are completed successfully, the result is an aggregate list of returned values. The order of result values corresponds to the order of awaitables in aws.

If return_exceptions is False (default), the first raised exception is immediately propagated to the task that awaits on gather(). Other awaitables in the aws sequence won’t be cancelled and will continue to run.

If return_exceptions is True, exceptions are treated the same as successful results, and aggregated in the result list.

If gather() is cancelled, all submitted awaitables (that have not completed yet) are also cancelled.

If any Task or Future from the aws sequence is cancelled, it is treated as if it raised CancelledError – the gather() call is not cancelled in this case. This is to prevent the cancellation of one submitted Task/Future to cause other Tasks/Futures to be cancelled.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

import asyncio

async def factorial(name, number):
    f = 1
    for i in range(2, number + 1):
        print(f"Task {name}: Compute factorial({i})...")
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        f *= i
    print(f"Task {name}: factorial({number}) = {f}")

async def main():
    # Schedule three calls *concurrently*:
    await asyncio.gather(
        factorial("A", 2),
        factorial("B", 3),
        factorial("C", 4),
    )

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     Task A: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task B: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task C: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task A: factorial(2) = 2
#     Task B: Compute factorial(3)...
#     Task C: Compute factorial(3)...
#     Task B: factorial(3) = 6
#     Task C: Compute factorial(4)...
#     Task C: factorial(4) = 24
Changed in version 3.7: If the gather itself is cancelled, the cancellation is propagated regardless of return_exceptions.

Shielding From Cancellation
awaitable asyncio.shield(aw, *, loop=None)
Protect an awaitable object from being cancelled.

If aw is a coroutine it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

The statement:

res = await shield(something())
is equivalent to:

res = await something()
except that if the coroutine containing it is cancelled, the Task running in something() is not cancelled. From the point of view of something(), the cancellation did not happen. Although its caller is still cancelled, so the “await” expression still raises a CancelledError.

If something() is cancelled by other means (i.e. from within itself) that would also cancel shield().

If it is desired to completely ignore cancellation (not recommended) the shield() function should be combined with a try/except clause, as follows:

try:
    res = await shield(something())
except CancelledError:
    res = None
Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Timeouts
coroutine asyncio.wait_for(aw, timeout, *, loop=None)
Wait for the aw awaitable to complete with a timeout.

If aw is a coroutine it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

timeout can either be None or a float or int number of seconds to wait for. If timeout is None, block until the future completes.

If a timeout occurs, it cancels the task and raises asyncio.TimeoutError.

To avoid the task cancellation, wrap it in shield().

The function will wait until the future is actually cancelled, so the total wait time may exceed the timeout.

If the wait is cancelled, the future aw is also cancelled.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

async def eternity():
    # Sleep for one hour
    await asyncio.sleep(3600)
    print('yay!')

async def main():
    # Wait for at most 1 second
    try:
        await asyncio.wait_for(eternity(), timeout=1.0)
    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        print('timeout!')

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     timeout!
Changed in version 3.7: When aw is cancelled due to a timeout, wait_for waits for aw to be cancelled. Previously, it raised asyncio.TimeoutError immediately.

Waiting Primitives
coroutine asyncio.wait(aws, *, loop=None, timeout=None, return_when=ALL_COMPLETED)
Run awaitable objects in the aws set concurrently and block until the condition specified by return_when.

Returns two sets of Tasks/Futures: (done, pending).

Usage:

done, pending = await asyncio.wait(aws)
timeout (a float or int), if specified, can be used to control the maximum number of seconds to wait before returning.

Note that this function does not raise asyncio.TimeoutError. Futures or Tasks that aren’t done when the timeout occurs are simply returned in the second set.

return_when indicates when this function should return. It must be one of the following constants:

Constant

Description

FIRST_COMPLETED

The function will return when any future finishes or is cancelled.

FIRST_EXCEPTION

The function will return when any future finishes by raising an exception. If no future raises an exception then it is equivalent to ALL_COMPLETED.

ALL_COMPLETED

The function will return when all futures finish or are cancelled.

Unlike wait_for(), wait() does not cancel the futures when a timeout occurs.

Deprecated since version 3.8: If any awaitable in aws is a coroutine, it is automatically scheduled as a Task. Passing coroutines objects to wait() directly is deprecated as it leads to confusing behavior.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Note wait() schedules coroutines as Tasks automatically and later returns those implicitly created Task objects in (done, pending) sets. Therefore the following code won’t work as expected:
async def foo():
    return 42

coro = foo()
done, pending = await asyncio.wait({coro})

if coro in done:
    # This branch will never be run!
Here is how the above snippet can be fixed:

async def foo():
    return 42

task = asyncio.create_task(foo())
done, pending = await asyncio.wait({task})

if task in done:
    # Everything will work as expected now.
Deprecated since version 3.8: Passing coroutine objects to wait() directly is deprecated.

asyncio.as_completed(aws, *, loop=None, timeout=None)
Run awaitable objects in the aws set concurrently. Return an iterator of Future objects. Each Future object returned represents the earliest result from the set of the remaining awaitables.

Raises asyncio.TimeoutError if the timeout occurs before all Futures are done.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

for f in as_completed(aws):
    earliest_result = await f
    # ...
Scheduling From Other Threads
asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro, loop)
Submit a coroutine to the given event loop. Thread-safe.

Return a concurrent.futures.Future to wait for the result from another OS thread.

This function is meant to be called from a different OS thread than the one where the event loop is running. Example:

# Create a coroutine
coro = asyncio.sleep(1, result=3)

# Submit the coroutine to a given loop
future = asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro, loop)

# Wait for the result with an optional timeout argument
assert future.result(timeout) == 3
If an exception is raised in the coroutine, the returned Future will be notified. It can also be used to cancel the task in the event loop:

try:
    result = future.result(timeout)
except asyncio.TimeoutError:
    print('The coroutine took too long, cancelling the task...')
    future.cancel()
except Exception as exc:
    print(f'The coroutine raised an exception: {exc!r}')
else:
    print(f'The coroutine returned: {result!r}')
See the concurrency and multithreading section of the documentation.

Unlike other asyncio functions this function requires the loop argument to be passed explicitly.

New in version 3.5.1.

Introspection
asyncio.current_task(loop=None)
Return the currently running Task instance, or None if no task is running.

If loop is None get_running_loop() is used to get the current loop.

New in version 3.7.

asyncio.all_tasks(loop=None)
Return a set of not yet finished Task objects run by the loop.

If loop is None, get_running_loop() is used for getting current loop.

New in version 3.7.

Task Object
class asyncio.Task(coro, *, loop=None, name=None)
A Future-like object that runs a Python coroutine. Not thread-safe.

Tasks are used to run coroutines in event loops. If a coroutine awaits on a Future, the Task suspends the execution of the coroutine and waits for the completion of the Future. When the Future is done, the execution of the wrapped coroutine resumes.

Event loops use cooperative scheduling: an event loop runs one Task at a time. While a Task awaits for the completion of a Future, the event loop runs other Tasks, callbacks, or performs IO operations.

Use the high-level asyncio.create_task() function to create Tasks, or the low-level loop.create_task() or ensure_future() functions. Manual instantiation of Tasks is discouraged.

To cancel a running Task use the cancel() method. Calling it will cause the Task to throw a CancelledError exception into the wrapped coroutine. If a coroutine is awaiting on a Future object during cancellation, the Future object will be cancelled.

cancelled() can be used to check if the Task was cancelled. The method returns True if the wrapped coroutine did not suppress the CancelledError exception and was actually cancelled.

asyncio.Task inherits from Future all of its APIs except Future.set_result() and Future.set_exception().

Tasks support the contextvars module. When a Task is created it copies the current context and later runs its coroutine in the copied context.

Changed in version 3.7: Added support for the contextvars module.

Changed in version 3.8: Added the name parameter.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

cancel()
Request the Task to be cancelled.

This arranges for a CancelledError exception to be thrown into the wrapped coroutine on the next cycle of the event loop.

The coroutine then has a chance to clean up or even deny the request by suppressing the exception with a try … … except CancelledError … finally block. Therefore, unlike Future.cancel(), Task.cancel() does not guarantee that the Task will be cancelled, although suppressing cancellation completely is not common and is actively discouraged.

The following example illustrates how coroutines can intercept the cancellation request:

async def cancel_me():
    print('cancel_me(): before sleep')

    try:
        # Wait for 1 hour
        await asyncio.sleep(3600)
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print('cancel_me(): cancel sleep')
        raise
    finally:
        print('cancel_me(): after sleep')

async def main():
    # Create a "cancel_me" Task
    task = asyncio.create_task(cancel_me())

    # Wait for 1 second
    await asyncio.sleep(1)

    task.cancel()
    try:
        await task
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print("main(): cancel_me is cancelled now")

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     cancel_me(): before sleep
#     cancel_me(): cancel sleep
#     cancel_me(): after sleep
#     main(): cancel_me is cancelled now
cancelled()
Return True if the Task is cancelled.

The Task is cancelled when the cancellation was requested with cancel() and the wrapped coroutine propagated the CancelledError exception thrown into it.

done()
Return True if the Task is done.

A Task is done when the wrapped coroutine either returned a value, raised an exception, or the Task was cancelled.

result()
Return the result of the Task.

If the Task is done, the result of the wrapped coroutine is returned (or if the coroutine raised an exception, that exception is re-raised.)

If the Task has been cancelled, this method raises a CancelledError exception.

If the Task’s result isn’t yet available, this method raises a InvalidStateError exception.

exception()
Return the exception of the Task.

If the wrapped coroutine raised an exception that exception is returned. If the wrapped coroutine returned normally this method returns None.

If the Task has been cancelled, this method raises a CancelledError exception.

If the Task isn’t done yet, this method raises an InvalidStateError exception.

add_done_callback(callback, *, context=None)
Add a callback to be run when the Task is done.

This method should only be used in low-level callback-based code.

See the documentation of Future.add_done_callback() for more details.

remove_done_callback(callback)
Remove callback from the callbacks list.

This method should only be used in low-level callback-based code.

See the documentation of Future.remove_done_callback() for more details.

get_stack(*, limit=None)
Return the list of stack frames for this Task.

If the wrapped coroutine is not done, this returns the stack where it is suspended. If the coroutine has completed successfully or was cancelled, this returns an empty list. If the coroutine was terminated by an exception, this returns the list of traceback frames.

The frames are always ordered from oldest to newest.

Only one stack frame is returned for a suspended coroutine.

The optional limit argument sets the maximum number of frames to return; by default all available frames are returned. The ordering of the returned list differs depending on whether a stack or a traceback is returned: the newest frames of a stack are returned, but the oldest frames of a traceback are returned. (This matches the behavior of the traceback module.)

print_stack(*, limit=None, file=None)
Print the stack or traceback for this Task.

This produces output similar to that of the traceback module for the frames retrieved by get_stack().

The limit argument is passed to get_stack() directly.

The file argument is an I/O stream to which the output is written; by default output is written to sys.stderr.

get_coro()
Return the coroutine object wrapped by the Task.

New in version 3.8.

get_name()
Return the name of the Task.

If no name has been explicitly assigned to the Task, the default asyncio Task implementation generates a default name during instantiation.

New in version 3.8.

set_name(value)
Set the name of the Task.

The value argument can be any object, which is then converted to a string.

In the default Task implementation, the name will be visible in the repr() output of a task object.

New in version 3.8.

classmethod all_tasks(loop=None)
Return a set of all tasks for an event loop.

By default all tasks for the current event loop are returned. If loop is None, the get_event_loop() function is used to get the current loop.

Deprecated since version 3.7, will be removed in version 3.9: Do not call this as a task method. Use the asyncio.all_tasks() function instead.

classmethod current_task(loop=None)
Return the currently running task or None.

If loop is None, the get_event_loop() function is used to get the current loop.

Deprecated since version 3.7, will be removed in version 3.9: Do not call this as a task method. Use the asyncio.current_task() function instead.

Generator-based Coroutines
Note Support for generator-based coroutines is deprecated and is scheduled for removal in Python 3.10.
Generator-based coroutines predate async/await syntax. They are Python generators that use yield from expressions to await on Futures and other coroutines.

Generator-based coroutines should be decorated with @asyncio.coroutine, although this is not enforced.

@asyncio.coroutine
Decorator to mark generator-based coroutines.

This decorator enables legacy generator-based coroutines to be compatible with async/await code:

@asyncio.coroutine
def old_style_coroutine():
    yield from asyncio.sleep(1)

async def main():
    await old_style_coroutine()
This decorator should not be used for async def coroutines.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: Use async def instead.

asyncio.iscoroutine(obj)
Return True if obj is a coroutine object.

This method is different from inspect.iscoroutine() because it returns True for generator-based coroutines.

asyncio.iscoroutinefunction(func)
Return True if func is a coroutine function.

This method is different from inspect.iscoroutinefunction() because it returns True for generator-based coroutine functions decorated with @coroutine.

Three more challenges you may encounter include:

Scheduling—A distributed system has to decide which jobs need to run, when they should run, and where they should run. Schedulers ultimately have limitations, leading to underutilized hardware and unpredictable runtimes.
Latency—The more widely your system is distributed, the more latency you can experience with communications. This often leads to teams making tradeoffs between availability, consistency, and latency.
Observability—Gathering, processing, presenting, and monitoring hardware usage metrics for large clusters is a significant challenge.
How a Distributed System Works
Hardware and software architectures are used to maintain a distributed system. Everything must be interconnected—CPUs via the network and processes via the communication system.

Producer Mel Gibson will not be using paid advertisements to promote The Passion of the Christ to voters in next year's Academy Awards.

Gibson and his Icon Productions partner Bruce Davey said they would not be campaigning in print, radio or TV for success at the Oscars in February. "This film should be judged on its artistic merit, not who spends more money on advertising," Davey said. But DVDs will be sent to Oscar voters, who will be invited to screenings. Icon spent very little on advertising the film, which deals with the last hours of Jesus Christ's life, when it was released earlier this year - instead, it made the film available for special screenings at churches. It went on to gross over $600m (£322m) in ticket sales worldwide. Over recent years, marketing films to the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has become a multi-million dollar industry. Last year, the academy formed a committee to tighten the rules after the campaigns spilled over into personal attacks between studios. Academy president Frank Pierson praised Gibson's move for working to restore the Oscars as a "celebration and appreciation of excellence," and resisting the "crass commercialisation that was threatening the integrity of the award".

No UK premiere for Rings musical

The producers behind the Lord of the Rings musical have abandoned plans to premiere the show in London because no suitable theatre was available.

The £11.5m show will make its debut in Toronto in March 2006, after it was found that all three West End theatres with sufficient capacity were booked. The musical is not expected in London before December 2006. Producer Kevin Wallace said it would be "worth waiting for". "It will be like nothing they have ever seen before." "I know there will be a lot of disappointed British Tolkien fans who hoped to see the show in London, but we couldn't get a London theatre in time," added the British producer. The world premiere of the stage musical, co-produced by Canadian theatrical impresarios David and Ed Mirvish, will take place at Toronto's Princess of Wales Theatre next year.

"Toronto really wanted this premiere. The Tolkien books and films are hugely popular in Canada," said Mr Wallace, shortly after signing the deal in Canada. "We hope the anticipation and excitement over here will create an even bigger buzz by the time we open in London." Auditions begin in Canada on Thursday, but up to five British actors may join the cast, under a deal struck with Canadian Actors' Equity. The music for the show is being written by Bollywood composer AR Rahman, who was behind Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End musical Bollywood Dreams, and in conjuction with the Finnish group Varttina.

"There will be no singing and dancing Hobbits. The music will be in a very traditional mould and draw on ethnic traditions," assured Mr Wallace. The musical's British director is Matthew Warchus, best known for staging the worldwide stage hit Art. "The production will be a hybrid of text, physical theatre, music and spectacle never previously seen on this scale," he said. "Only in the theatre are we actually plunged into the events as they happen. The environment surrounds us and we are in Middle Earth." New Zealander Peter Jackson took 10 years to bring JRR Tolkien's fantasy trilogy to the big screen, winning Academy Awards for best film and best director for the final film The Return of the King in 2004.

The producers behind the Lord of the Rings musical have abandoned plans to premiere the show in London because no suitable theatre was available.

The £11.5m show will make its debut in Toronto in March 2006, after it was found that all three West End theatres with sufficient capacity were booked. The musical is not expected in London before December 2006. Producer Kevin Wallace said it would be "worth waiting for". "It will be like nothing they have ever seen before." "I know there will be a lot of disappointed British Tolkien fans who hoped to see the show in London, but we couldn't get a London theatre in time," added the British producer. The world premiere of the stage musical, co-produced by Canadian theatrical impresarios David and Ed Mirvish, will take place at Toronto's Princess of Wales Theatre next year.

"Toronto really wanted this premiere. The Tolkien books and films are hugely popular in Canada," said Mr Wallace, shortly after signing the deal in Canada. "We hope the anticipation and excitement over here will create an even bigger buzz by the time we open in London." Auditions begin in Canada on Thursday, but up to five British actors may join the cast, under a deal struck with Canadian Actors' Equity. The music for the show is being written by Bollywood composer AR Rahman, who was behind Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End musical Bollywood Dreams, and in conjuction with the Finnish group Varttina.

"There will be no singing and dancing Hobbits. The music will be in a very traditional mould and draw on ethnic traditions," assured Mr Wallace. The musical's British director is Matthew Warchus, best known for staging the worldwide stage hit Art. "The production will be a hybrid of text, physical theatre, music and spectacle never previously seen on this scale," he said. "Only in the theatre are we actually plunged into the events as they happen. The environment surrounds us and we are in Middle Earth." New Zealander Peter Jackson took 10 years to bring JRR Tolkien's fantasy trilogy to the big screen, winning Academy Awards for best film and best director for the final film The Return of the King in 2004.
No ads for Passion Oscar campaign

Producer Mel Gibson will not be using paid advertisements to promote The Passion of the Christ to voters in next year's Academy Awards.

Gibson and his Icon Productions partner Bruce Davey said they would not be campaigning in print, radio or TV for success at the Oscars in February. "This film should be judged on its artistic merit, not who spends more money on advertising," Davey said. But DVDs will be sent to Oscar voters, who will be invited to screenings. Icon spent very little on advertising the film, which deals with the last hours of Jesus Christ's life, when it was released earlier this year - instead, it made the film available for special screenings at churches. It went on to gross over $600m (£322m) in ticket sales worldwide. Over recent years, marketing films to the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has become a multi-million dollar industry. Last year, the academy formed a committee to tighten the rules after the campaigns spilled over into personal attacks between studios. Academy president Frank Pierson praised Gibson's move for working to restore the Oscars as a "celebration and appreciation of excellence," and resisting the "crass commercialisation that was threatening the integrity of the award".

The asyncio.run() function to run the top-level entry point “main()” function (see the above example.)

Awaiting on a coroutine. The following snippet of code will print “hello” after waiting for 1 second, and then print “world” after waiting for another 2 seconds:

import asyncio
import time

async def say_after(delay, what):
    await asyncio.sleep(delay)
    print(what)

async def main():
    print(f"started at {time.strftime('%X')}")

    await say_after(1, 'hello')
    await say_after(2, 'world')

    print(f"finished at {time.strftime('%X')}")

asyncio.run(main())
Expected output:

started at 17:13:52
hello
world
finished at 17:13:55
The asyncio.create_task() function to run coroutines concurrently as asyncio Tasks.

Let’s modify the above example and run two say_after coroutines concurrently:

async def main():
    task1 = asyncio.create_task(
        say_after(1, 'hello'))

    task2 = asyncio.create_task(
        say_after(2, 'world'))

    print(f"started at {time.strftime('%X')}")

    # Wait until both tasks are completed (should take
    # around 2 seconds.)
    await task1
    await task2

    print(f"finished at {time.strftime('%X')}")
Note that expected output now shows that the snippet runs 1 second faster than before:

started at 17:14:32
hello
world
finished at 17:14:34
Awaitables
We say that an object is an awaitable object if it can be used in an await expression. Many asyncio APIs are designed to accept awaitables.

There are three main types of awaitable objects: coroutines, Tasks, and Futures.

Coroutines

Python coroutines are awaitables and therefore can be awaited from other coroutines:

import asyncio

async def nested():
    return 42

async def main():
    # Nothing happens if we just call "nested()".
    # A coroutine object is created but not awaited,
    # so it *won't run at all*.
    nested()

    # Let's do it differently now and await it:
    print(await nested())  # will print "42".

asyncio.run(main())
Important In this documentation the term “coroutine” can be used for two closely related concepts:
a coroutine function: an async def function;

a coroutine object: an object returned by calling a coroutine function.

asyncio also supports legacy generator-based coroutines.

Tasks

Tasks are used to schedule coroutines concurrently.

When a coroutine is wrapped into a Task with functions like asyncio.create_task() the coroutine is automatically scheduled to run soon:

import asyncio

async def nested():
    return 42

async def main():
    # Schedule nested() to run soon concurrently
    # with "main()".
    task = asyncio.create_task(nested())

    # "task" can now be used to cancel "nested()", or
    # can simply be awaited to wait until it is complete:
    await task

asyncio.run(main())
Futures

A Future is a special low-level awaitable object that represents an eventual result of an asynchronous operation.

When a Future object is awaited it means that the coroutine will wait until the Future is resolved in some other place.

Future objects in asyncio are needed to allow callback-based code to be used with async/await.

Normally there is no need to create Future objects at the application level code.

Future objects, sometimes exposed by libraries and some asyncio APIs, can be awaited:

async def main():
    await function_that_returns_a_future_object()

    # this is also valid:
    await asyncio.gather(
        function_that_returns_a_future_object(),
        some_python_coroutine()
    )
A good example of a low-level function that returns a Future object is loop.run_in_executor().

Running an asyncio Program
asyncio.run(coro, *, debug=False)
Execute the coroutine coro and return the result.

This function runs the passed coroutine, taking care of managing the asyncio event loop and finalizing asynchronous generators.

This function cannot be called when another asyncio event loop is running in the same thread.

If debug is True, the event loop will be run in debug mode.

This function always creates a new event loop and closes it at the end. It should be used as a main entry point for asyncio programs, and should ideally only be called once.

Example:

async def main():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print('hello')

asyncio.run(main())
New in version 3.7.

Note The source code for asyncio.run() can be found in Lib/asyncio/runners.py.
Creating Tasks
asyncio.create_task(coro, *, name=None)
Wrap the coro coroutine into a Task and schedule its execution. Return the Task object.

If name is not None, it is set as the name of the task using Task.set_name().

The task is executed in the loop returned by get_running_loop(), RuntimeError is raised if there is no running loop in current thread.

This function has been added in Python 3.7. Prior to Python 3.7, the low-level asyncio.ensure_future() function can be used instead:

async def coro():
    ...

# In Python 3.7+
task = asyncio.create_task(coro())
...

# This works in all Python versions but is less readable
task = asyncio.ensure_future(coro())
...
New in version 3.7.

Changed in version 3.8: Added the name parameter.

Sleeping
coroutine asyncio.sleep(delay, result=None, *, loop=None)
Block for delay seconds.

If result is provided, it is returned to the caller when the coroutine completes.

sleep() always suspends the current task, allowing other tasks to run.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example of coroutine displaying the current date every second for 5 seconds:

import asyncio
import datetime

async def display_date():
    loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
    end_time = loop.time() + 5.0
    while True:
        print(datetime.datetime.now())
        if (loop.time() + 1.0) >= end_time:
            break
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

asyncio.run(display_date())
Running Tasks Concurrently
awaitable asyncio.gather(*aws, loop=None, return_exceptions=False)
Run awaitable objects in the aws sequence concurrently.

If any awaitable in aws is a coroutine, it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

If all awaitables are completed successfully, the result is an aggregate list of returned values. The order of result values corresponds to the order of awaitables in aws.

If return_exceptions is False (default), the first raised exception is immediately propagated to the task that awaits on gather(). Other awaitables in the aws sequence won’t be cancelled and will continue to run.

If return_exceptions is True, exceptions are treated the same as successful results, and aggregated in the result list.

If gather() is cancelled, all submitted awaitables (that have not completed yet) are also cancelled.

If any Task or Future from the aws sequence is cancelled, it is treated as if it raised CancelledError – the gather() call is not cancelled in this case. This is to prevent the cancellation of one submitted Task/Future to cause other Tasks/Futures to be cancelled.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

import asyncio

async def factorial(name, number):
    f = 1
    for i in range(2, number + 1):
        print(f"Task {name}: Compute factorial({i})...")
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        f *= i
    print(f"Task {name}: factorial({number}) = {f}")

async def main():
    # Schedule three calls *concurrently*:
    await asyncio.gather(
        factorial("A", 2),
        factorial("B", 3),
        factorial("C", 4),
    )

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     Task A: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task B: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task C: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task A: factorial(2) = 2
#     Task B: Compute factorial(3)...
#     Task C: Compute factorial(3)...
#     Task B: factorial(3) = 6
#     Task C: Compute factorial(4)...
#     Task C: factorial(4) = 24
Changed in version 3.7: If the gather itself is cancelled, the cancellation is propagated regardless of return_exceptions.

Shielding From Cancellation
awaitable asyncio.shield(aw, *, loop=None)
Protect an awaitable object from being cancelled.

If aw is a coroutine it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

The statement:

res = await shield(something())
is equivalent to:

res = await something()
except that if the coroutine containing it is cancelled, the Task running in something() is not cancelled. From the point of view of something(), the cancellation did not happen. Although its caller is still cancelled, so the “await” expression still raises a CancelledError.

If something() is cancelled by other means (i.e. from within itself) that would also cancel shield().

If it is desired to completely ignore cancellation (not recommended) the shield() function should be combined with a try/except clause, as follows:

try:
    res = await shield(something())
except CancelledError:
    res = None
Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Timeouts
coroutine asyncio.wait_for(aw, timeout, *, loop=None)
Wait for the aw awaitable to complete with a timeout.

If aw is a coroutine it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

timeout can either be None or a float or int number of seconds to wait for. If timeout is None, block until the future completes.

If a timeout occurs, it cancels the task and raises asyncio.TimeoutError.

To avoid the task cancellation, wrap it in shield().

The function will wait until the future is actually cancelled, so the total wait time may exceed the timeout.

If the wait is cancelled, the future aw is also cancelled.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

async def eternity():
    # Sleep for one hour
    await asyncio.sleep(3600)
    print('yay!')

async def main():
    # Wait for at most 1 second
    try:
        await asyncio.wait_for(eternity(), timeout=1.0)
    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        print('timeout!')

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     timeout!
Changed in version 3.7: When aw is cancelled due to a timeout, wait_for waits for aw to be cancelled. Previously, it raised asyncio.TimeoutError immediately.

Waiting Primitives
coroutine asyncio.wait(aws, *, loop=None, timeout=None, return_when=ALL_COMPLETED)
Run awaitable objects in the aws set concurrently and block until the condition specified by return_when.

Returns two sets of Tasks/Futures: (done, pending).

Usage:

done, pending = await asyncio.wait(aws)
timeout (a float or int), if specified, can be used to control the maximum number of seconds to wait before returning.

Note that this function does not raise asyncio.TimeoutError. Futures or Tasks that aren’t done when the timeout occurs are simply returned in the second set.

return_when indicates when this function should return. It must be one of the following constants:

Constant

Description

FIRST_COMPLETED

The function will return when any future finishes or is cancelled.

FIRST_EXCEPTION

The function will return when any future finishes by raising an exception. If no future raises an exception then it is equivalent to ALL_COMPLETED.

ALL_COMPLETED

The function will return when all futures finish or are cancelled.

Unlike wait_for(), wait() does not cancel the futures when a timeout occurs.

Deprecated since version 3.8: If any awaitable in aws is a coroutine, it is automatically scheduled as a Task. Passing coroutines objects to wait() directly is deprecated as it leads to confusing behavior.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Note wait() schedules coroutines as Tasks automatically and later returns those implicitly created Task objects in (done, pending) sets. Therefore the following code won’t work as expected:
async def foo():
    return 42

coro = foo()
done, pending = await asyncio.wait({coro})

if coro in done:
    # This branch will never be run!
Here is how the above snippet can be fixed:

async def foo():
    return 42

task = asyncio.create_task(foo())
done, pending = await asyncio.wait({task})

if task in done:
    # Everything will work as expected now.
Deprecated since version 3.8: Passing coroutine objects to wait() directly is deprecated.

asyncio.as_completed(aws, *, loop=None, timeout=None)
Run awaitable objects in the aws set concurrently. Return an iterator of Future objects. Each Future object returned represents the earliest result from the set of the remaining awaitables.

Raises asyncio.TimeoutError if the timeout occurs before all Futures are done.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

for f in as_completed(aws):
    earliest_result = await f
    # ...
Scheduling From Other Threads
asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro, loop)
Submit a coroutine to the given event loop. Thread-safe.

Return a concurrent.futures.Future to wait for the result from another OS thread.

This function is meant to be called from a different OS thread than the one where the event loop is running. Example:

# Create a coroutine
coro = asyncio.sleep(1, result=3)

# Submit the coroutine to a given loop
future = asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro, loop)

# Wait for the result with an optional timeout argument
assert future.result(timeout) == 3
If an exception is raised in the coroutine, the returned Future will be notified. It can also be used to cancel the task in the event loop:

try:
    result = future.result(timeout)
except asyncio.TimeoutError:
    print('The coroutine took too long, cancelling the task...')
    future.cancel()
except Exception as exc:
    print(f'The coroutine raised an exception: {exc!r}')
else:
    print(f'The coroutine returned: {result!r}')
See the concurrency and multithreading section of the documentation.

Unlike other asyncio functions this function requires the loop argument to be passed explicitly.

New in version 3.5.1.

Introspection
asyncio.current_task(loop=None)
Return the currently running Task instance, or None if no task is running.

If loop is None get_running_loop() is used to get the current loop.

New in version 3.7.

asyncio.all_tasks(loop=None)
Return a set of not yet finished Task objects run by the loop.

If loop is None, get_running_loop() is used for getting current loop.

New in version 3.7.

Task Object
class asyncio.Task(coro, *, loop=None, name=None)
A Future-like object that runs a Python coroutine. Not thread-safe.

Tasks are used to run coroutines in event loops. If a coroutine awaits on a Future, the Task suspends the execution of the coroutine and waits for the completion of the Future. When the Future is done, the execution of the wrapped coroutine resumes.

Event loops use cooperative scheduling: an event loop runs one Task at a time. While a Task awaits for the completion of a Future, the event loop runs other Tasks, callbacks, or performs IO operations.

Use the high-level asyncio.create_task() function to create Tasks, or the low-level loop.create_task() or ensure_future() functions. Manual instantiation of Tasks is discouraged.

To cancel a running Task use the cancel() method. Calling it will cause the Task to throw a CancelledError exception into the wrapped coroutine. If a coroutine is awaiting on a Future object during cancellation, the Future object will be cancelled.

cancelled() can be used to check if the Task was cancelled. The method returns True if the wrapped coroutine did not suppress the CancelledError exception and was actually cancelled.

asyncio.Task inherits from Future all of its APIs except Future.set_result() and Future.set_exception().

Tasks support the contextvars module. When a Task is created it copies the current context and later runs its coroutine in the copied context.

Changed in version 3.7: Added support for the contextvars module.

Changed in version 3.8: Added the name parameter.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

cancel()
Request the Task to be cancelled.

This arranges for a CancelledError exception to be thrown into the wrapped coroutine on the next cycle of the event loop.

The coroutine then has a chance to clean up or even deny the request by suppressing the exception with a try … … except CancelledError … finally block. Therefore, unlike Future.cancel(), Task.cancel() does not guarantee that the Task will be cancelled, although suppressing cancellation completely is not common and is actively discouraged.

The following example illustrates how coroutines can intercept the cancellation request:

async def cancel_me():
    print('cancel_me(): before sleep')

    try:
        # Wait for 1 hour
        await asyncio.sleep(3600)
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print('cancel_me(): cancel sleep')
        raise
    finally:
        print('cancel_me(): after sleep')

async def main():
    # Create a "cancel_me" Task
    task = asyncio.create_task(cancel_me())

    # Wait for 1 second
    await asyncio.sleep(1)

    task.cancel()
    try:
        await task
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print("main(): cancel_me is cancelled now")

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     cancel_me(): before sleep
#     cancel_me(): cancel sleep
#     cancel_me(): after sleep
#     main(): cancel_me is cancelled now
cancelled()
Return True if the Task is cancelled.

The Task is cancelled when the cancellation was requested with cancel() and the wrapped coroutine propagated the CancelledError exception thrown into it.

done()
Return True if the Task is done.

A Task is done when the wrapped coroutine either returned a value, raised an exception, or the Task was cancelled.

result()
Return the result of the Task.

If the Task is done, the result of the wrapped coroutine is returned (or if the coroutine raised an exception, that exception is re-raised.)

If the Task has been cancelled, this method raises a CancelledError exception.

If the Task’s result isn’t yet available, this method raises a InvalidStateError exception.

exception()
Return the exception of the Task.

If the wrapped coroutine raised an exception that exception is returned. If the wrapped coroutine returned normally this method returns None.

If the Task has been cancelled, this method raises a CancelledError exception.

If the Task isn’t done yet, this method raises an InvalidStateError exception.

add_done_callback(callback, *, context=None)
Add a callback to be run when the Task is done.

This method should only be used in low-level callback-based code.

See the documentation of Future.add_done_callback() for more details.

remove_done_callback(callback)
Remove callback from the callbacks list.

This method should only be used in low-level callback-based code.

See the documentation of Future.remove_done_callback() for more details.

get_stack(*, limit=None)
Return the list of stack frames for this Task.

If the wrapped coroutine is not done, this returns the stack where it is suspended. If the coroutine has completed successfully or was cancelled, this returns an empty list. If the coroutine was terminated by an exception, this returns the list of traceback frames.

The frames are always ordered from oldest to newest.

Only one stack frame is returned for a suspended coroutine.

The optional limit argument sets the maximum number of frames to return; by default all available frames are returned. The ordering of the returned list differs depending on whether a stack or a traceback is returned: the newest frames of a stack are returned, but the oldest frames of a traceback are returned. (This matches the behavior of the traceback module.)

print_stack(*, limit=None, file=None)
Print the stack or traceback for this Task.

This produces output similar to that of the traceback module for the frames retrieved by get_stack().

The limit argument is passed to get_stack() directly.

The file argument is an I/O stream to which the output is written; by default output is written to sys.stderr.

get_coro()
Return the coroutine object wrapped by the Task.

New in version 3.8.

get_name()
Return the name of the Task.

If no name has been explicitly assigned to the Task, the default asyncio Task implementation generates a default name during instantiation.

New in version 3.8.

set_name(value)
Set the name of the Task.

The value argument can be any object, which is then converted to a string.

In the default Task implementation, the name will be visible in the repr() output of a task object.

New in version 3.8.

classmethod all_tasks(loop=None)
Return a set of all tasks for an event loop.

By default all tasks for the current event loop are returned. If loop is None, the get_event_loop() function is used to get the current loop.

Deprecated since version 3.7, will be removed in version 3.9: Do not call this as a task method. Use the asyncio.all_tasks() function instead.

classmethod current_task(loop=None)
Return the currently running task or None.

If loop is None, the get_event_loop() function is used to get the current loop.

Deprecated since version 3.7, will be removed in version 3.9: Do not call this as a task method. Use the asyncio.current_task() function instead.

Generator-based Coroutines
Note Support for generator-based coroutines is deprecated and is scheduled for removal in Python 3.10.
Generator-based coroutines predate async/await syntax. They are Python generators that use yield from expressions to await on Futures and other coroutines.

Generator-based coroutines should be decorated with @asyncio.coroutine, although this is not enforced.

@asyncio.coroutine
Decorator to mark generator-based coroutines.

This decorator enables legacy generator-based coroutines to be compatible with async/await code:

@asyncio.coroutine
def old_style_coroutine():
    yield from asyncio.sleep(1)

async def main():
    await old_style_coroutine()
This decorator should not be used for async def coroutines.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: Use async def instead.

asyncio.iscoroutine(obj)
Return True if obj is a coroutine object.

This method is different from inspect.iscoroutine() because it returns True for generator-based coroutines.

asyncio.iscoroutinefunction(func)
Return True if func is a coroutine function.

This method is different from inspect.iscoroutinefunction() because it returns True for generator-based coroutine functions decorated with @coroutine.

No UK premiere for Rings musical

The producers behind the Lord of the Rings musical have abandoned plans to premiere the show in London because no suitable theatre was available.

The £11.5m show will make its debut in Toronto in March 2006, after it was found that all three West End theatres with sufficient capacity were booked. The musical is not expected in London before December 2006. Producer Kevin Wallace said it would be "worth waiting for". "It will be like nothing they have ever seen before." "I know there will be a lot of disappointed British Tolkien fans who hoped to see the show in London, but we couldn't get a London theatre in time," added the British producer. The world premiere of the stage musical, co-produced by Canadian theatrical impresarios David and Ed Mirvish, will take place at Toronto's Princess of Wales Theatre next year.

"Toronto really wanted this premiere. The Tolkien books and films are hugely popular in Canada," said Mr Wallace, shortly after signing the deal in Canada. "We hope the anticipation and excitement over here will create an even bigger buzz by the time we open in London." Auditions begin in Canada on Thursday, but up to five British actors may join the cast, under a deal struck with Canadian Actors' Equity. The music for the show is being written by Bollywood composer AR Rahman, who was behind Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End musical Bollywood Dreams, and in conjuction with the Finnish group Varttina.

"There will be no singing and dancing Hobbits. The music will be in a very traditional mould and draw on ethnic traditions," assured Mr Wallace. The musical's British director is Matthew Warchus, best known for staging the worldwide stage hit Art. "The production will be a hybrid of text, physical theatre, music and spectacle never previously seen on this scale," he said. "Only in the theatre are we actually plunged into the events as they happen. The environment surrounds us and we are in Middle Earth." New Zealander Peter Jackson took 10 years to bring JRR Tolkien's fantasy trilogy to the big screen, winning Academy Awards for best film and best director for the final film The Return of the King in 2004.
No ads for Passion Oscar campaign

Producer Mel Gibson will not be using paid advertisements to promote The Passion of the Christ to voters in next year's Academy Awards.

Gibson and his Icon Productions partner Bruce Davey said they would not be campaigning in print, radio or TV for success at the Oscars in February. "This film should be judged on its artistic merit, not who spends more money on advertising," Davey said. But DVDs will be sent to Oscar voters, who will be invited to screenings. Icon spent very little on advertising the film, which deals with the last hours of Jesus Christ's life, when it was released earlier this year - instead, it made the film available for special screenings at churches. It went on to gross over $600m (£322m) in ticket sales worldwide. Over recent years, marketing films to the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has become a multi-million dollar industry. Last year, the academy formed a committee to tighten the rules after the campaigns spilled over into personal attacks between studios. Academy president Frank Pierson praised Gibson's move for working to restore the Oscars as a "celebration and appreciation of excellence," and resisting the "crass commercialisation that was threatening the integrity of the award".

The world premiere of the stage musical, co-produced by Canadian theatrical impresarios David and Ed Mirvish, will take place at Toronto's Princess of Wales Theatre next year.

"Toronto really wanted this premiere. The Tolkien books and films are hugely popular in Canada," said Mr Wallace, shortly after signing the deal in Canada. "We hope the anticipation and excitement over here will create an even bigger buzz by the time we open in London." Auditions begin in Canada on Thursday, but up to five British actors may join the cast, under a deal struck with Canadian Actors' Equity. The music for the show is being written by Bollywood composer AR Rahman, who was behind Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End musical Bollywood Dreams, and in conjuction with the Finnish group Varttina.

"There will be no singing and dancing Hobbits. The music will be in a very traditional mould and draw on ethnic traditions," assured Mr Wallace. The musical's British director is Matthew Warchus, best known for staging the worldwide stage hit Art. "The production will be a hybrid of text, physical theatre, music and spectacle never previously seen on this scale," he said. "Only in the theatre are we actually plunged into the events as they happen. The environment surrounds us and we are in Middle Earth." New Zealander Peter Jackson took 10 years to bring JRR Tolkien's fantasy trilogy to the big screen, winning Academy Awards for best film and best director for the final film The Return of the King in 2004.
No ads for Passion Oscar campaign

Producer Mel Gibson will not be using paid advertisements to promote The Passion of the Christ to voters in next year's Academy Awards.

Gibson and his Icon Productions partner Bruce Davey said they would not be campaigning in print, radio or TV for success at the Oscars in February. "This film should be judged on its artistic merit, not who spends more money on advertising," Davey said. But DVDs will be sent to Oscar voters, who will be invited to screenings. Icon spent very little on advertising the film, which deals with the last hours of Jesus Christ's life, when it was released earlier this year - instead, it made the film available for special screenings at churches. It went on to gross over $600m (£322m) in ticket sales worldwide. Over recent years, marketing films to the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has become a multi-million dollar industry. Last year, the academy formed a committee to tighten the rules after the campaigns spilled over into personal attacks between studios. Academy president Frank Pierson praised Gibson's move for working to restore the Oscars as a "celebration and appreciation of excellence," and resisting the "crass commercialisation that was threatening the integrity of the award".

A distributed system, also known as distributed computing, is a system with multiple components located on different machines that communicate and coordinate actions in order to appear as a single coherent system to the end-user.

Overview
The machines that are a part of a distributed system may be computers, physical servers, virtual machines, containers, or any other node that can connect to the network, have local memory, and communicate by passing messages.

There are two general ways that distributed systems function:

Each machine works toward a common goal and the end-user views results as one cohesive unit.
Each machine has its own end-user and the distributed system facilitates sharing resources or communication services.
Although distributed systems can sometimes be obscure, they usually have three primary characteristics: all components run concurrently, there is no global clock, and all components fail independently of each other.

Benefits and challenges of distributed systems
There are three reasons that teams generally decide to implement distributed systems:

Horizontal Scalability—Since computing happens independently on each node, it is easy and generally inexpensive to add additional nodes and functionality as necessary.
Reliability—Most distributed systems are fault-tolerant as they can be made up of hundreds of nodes that work together. The system generally doesn’t experience any disruptions if a single machine fails.
Performance—Distributed systems are extremely efficient because work loads can be broken up and sent to multiple machines.
However, distributed systems are not without challenges. Complex architectural design, construction, and debugging processes that are required to create an effective distributed system can be overwhelming.

>> import asyncio

>>> async def main():
...     print('hello')
...     await asyncio.sleep(1)
...     print('world')

>>> asyncio.run(main())
hello
world
Note that simply calling a coroutine will not schedule it to be executed:

>>>
>>> main()
<coroutine object main at 0x1053bb7c8>
To actually run a coroutine, asyncio provides three main mechanisms:

The asyncio.run() function to run the top-level entry point “main()” function (see the above example.)

Awaiting on a coroutine. The following snippet of code will print “hello” after waiting for 1 second, and then print “world” after waiting for another 2 seconds:

import asyncio
import time

async def say_after(delay, what):
    await asyncio.sleep(delay)
    print(what)

async def main():
    print(f"started at {time.strftime('%X')}")

    await say_after(1, 'hello')
    await say_after(2, 'world')

    print(f"finished at {time.strftime('%X')}")

asyncio.run(main())
Expected output:

started at 17:13:52
hello
world
finished at 17:13:55
The asyncio.create_task() function to run coroutines concurrently as asyncio Tasks.

Let’s modify the above example and run two say_after coroutines concurrently:

async def main():
    task1 = asyncio.create_task(
        say_after(1, 'hello'))

    task2 = asyncio.create_task(
        say_after(2, 'world'))

    print(f"started at {time.strftime('%X')}")

    # Wait until both tasks are completed (should take
    # around 2 seconds.)
    await task1
    await task2

    print(f"finished at {time.strftime('%X')}")
Note that expected output now shows that the snippet runs 1 second faster than before:

started at 17:14:32
hello
world
finished at 17:14:34
Awaitables
We say that an object is an awaitable object if it can be used in an await expression. Many asyncio APIs are designed to accept awaitables.

There are three main types of awaitable objects: coroutines, Tasks, and Futures.

Coroutines

Python coroutines are awaitables and therefore can be awaited from other coroutines:

import asyncio

async def nested():
    return 42

async def main():
    # Nothing happens if we just call "nested()".
    # A coroutine object is created but not awaited,
    # so it *won't run at all*.
    nested()

    # Let's do it differently now and await it:
    print(await nested())  # will print "42".

asyncio.run(main())
Important In this documentation the term “coroutine” can be used for two closely related concepts:
a coroutine function: an async def function;

a coroutine object: an object returned by calling a coroutine function.

asyncio also supports legacy generator-based coroutines.

Tasks

Tasks are used to schedule coroutines concurrently.

When a coroutine is wrapped into a Task with functions like asyncio.create_task() the coroutine is automatically scheduled to run soon:

import asyncio

async def nested():
    return 42

async def main():
    # Schedule nested() to run soon concurrently
    # with "main()".
    task = asyncio.create_task(nested())

    # "task" can now be used to cancel "nested()", or
    # can simply be awaited to wait until it is complete:
    await task

asyncio.run(main())
Futures

A Future is a special low-level awaitable object that represents an eventual result of an asynchronous operation.

When a Future object is awaited it means that the coroutine will wait until the Future is resolved in some other place.

Future objects in asyncio are needed to allow callback-based code to be used with async/await.

Normally there is no need to create Future objects at the application level code.

Future objects, sometimes exposed by libraries and some asyncio APIs, can be awaited:

async def main():
    await function_that_returns_a_future_object()

    # this is also valid:
    await asyncio.gather(
        function_that_returns_a_future_object(),
        some_python_coroutine()
    )
A good example of a low-level function that returns a Future object is loop.run_in_executor().

Running an asyncio Program
asyncio.run(coro, *, debug=False)
Execute the coroutine coro and return the result.

This function runs the passed coroutine, taking care of managing the asyncio event loop and finalizing asynchronous generators.

This function cannot be called when another asyncio event loop is running in the same thread.

If debug is True, the event loop will be run in debug mode.

This function always creates a new event loop and closes it at the end. It should be used as a main entry point for asyncio programs, and should ideally only be called once.

Example:

async def main():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print('hello')

asyncio.run(main())
New in version 3.7.

Note The source code for asyncio.run() can be found in Lib/asyncio/runners.py.
Creating Tasks
asyncio.create_task(coro, *, name=None)
Wrap the coro coroutine into a Task and schedule its execution. Return the Task object.

If name is not None, it is set as the name of the task using Task.set_name().

The task is executed in the loop returned by get_running_loop(), RuntimeError is raised if there is no running loop in current thread.

This function has been added in Python 3.7. Prior to Python 3.7, the low-level asyncio.ensure_future() function can be used instead:

async def coro():
    ...

# In Python 3.7+
task = asyncio.create_task(coro())
...

# This works in all Python versions but is less readable
task = asyncio.ensure_future(coro())
...
New in version 3.7.

Changed in version 3.8: Added the name parameter.

Sleeping
coroutine asyncio.sleep(delay, result=None, *, loop=None)
Block for delay seconds.

If result is provided, it is returned to the caller when the coroutine completes.

sleep() always suspends the current task, allowing other tasks to run.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example of coroutine displaying the current date every second for 5 seconds:

import asyncio
import datetime

async def display_date():
    loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
    end_time = loop.time() + 5.0
    while True:
        print(datetime.datetime.now())
        if (loop.time() + 1.0) >= end_time:
            break
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

asyncio.run(display_date())
Running Tasks Concurrently
awaitable asyncio.gather(*aws, loop=None, return_exceptions=False)
Run awaitable objects in the aws sequence concurrently.

If any awaitable in aws is a coroutine, it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

If all awaitables are completed successfully, the result is an aggregate list of returned values. The order of result values corresponds to the order of awaitables in aws.

If return_exceptions is False (default), the first raised exception is immediately propagated to the task that awaits on gather(). Other awaitables in the aws sequence won’t be cancelled and will continue to run.

If return_exceptions is True, exceptions are treated the same as successful results, and aggregated in the result list.

If gather() is cancelled, all submitted awaitables (that have not completed yet) are also cancelled.

If any Task or Future from the aws sequence is cancelled, it is treated as if it raised CancelledError – the gather() call is not cancelled in this case. This is to prevent the cancellation of one submitted Task/Future to cause other Tasks/Futures to be cancelled.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

import asyncio

async def factorial(name, number):
    f = 1
    for i in range(2, number + 1):
        print(f"Task {name}: Compute factorial({i})...")
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        f *= i
    print(f"Task {name}: factorial({number}) = {f}")

async def main():
    # Schedule three calls *concurrently*:
    await asyncio.gather(
        factorial("A", 2),
        factorial("B", 3),
        factorial("C", 4),
    )

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     Task A: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task B: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task C: Compute factorial(2)...
#     Task A: factorial(2) = 2
#     Task B: Compute factorial(3)...
#     Task C: Compute factorial(3)...
#     Task B: factorial(3) = 6
#     Task C: Compute factorial(4)...
#     Task C: factorial(4) = 24
Changed in version 3.7: If the gather itself is cancelled, the cancellation is propagated regardless of return_exceptions.

Shielding From Cancellation
awaitable asyncio.shield(aw, *, loop=None)
Protect an awaitable object from being cancelled.

If aw is a coroutine it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

The statement:

res = await shield(something())
is equivalent to:

res = await something()
except that if the coroutine containing it is cancelled, the Task running in something() is not cancelled. From the point of view of something(), the cancellation did not happen. Although its caller is still cancelled, so the “await” expression still raises a CancelledError.

If something() is cancelled by other means (i.e. from within itself) that would also cancel shield().

If it is desired to completely ignore cancellation (not recommended) the shield() function should be combined with a try/except clause, as follows:

try:
    res = await shield(something())
except CancelledError:
    res = None
Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Timeouts
coroutine asyncio.wait_for(aw, timeout, *, loop=None)
Wait for the aw awaitable to complete with a timeout.

If aw is a coroutine it is automatically scheduled as a Task.

timeout can either be None or a float or int number of seconds to wait for. If timeout is None, block until the future completes.

If a timeout occurs, it cancels the task and raises asyncio.TimeoutError.

To avoid the task cancellation, wrap it in shield().

The function will wait until the future is actually cancelled, so the total wait time may exceed the timeout.

If the wait is cancelled, the future aw is also cancelled.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

async def eternity():
    # Sleep for one hour
    await asyncio.sleep(3600)
    print('yay!')

async def main():
    # Wait for at most 1 second
    try:
        await asyncio.wait_for(eternity(), timeout=1.0)
    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        print('timeout!')

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     timeout!
Changed in version 3.7: When aw is cancelled due to a timeout, wait_for waits for aw to be cancelled. Previously, it raised asyncio.TimeoutError immediately.

Waiting Primitives
coroutine asyncio.wait(aws, *, loop=None, timeout=None, return_when=ALL_COMPLETED)
Run awaitable objects in the aws set concurrently and block until the condition specified by return_when.

Returns two sets of Tasks/Futures: (done, pending).

Usage:

done, pending = await asyncio.wait(aws)
timeout (a float or int), if specified, can be used to control the maximum number of seconds to wait before returning.

Note that this function does not raise asyncio.TimeoutError. Futures or Tasks that aren’t done when the timeout occurs are simply returned in the second set.

return_when indicates when this function should return. It must be one of the following constants:

Constant

Description

FIRST_COMPLETED

The function will return when any future finishes or is cancelled.

FIRST_EXCEPTION

The function will return when any future finishes by raising an exception. If no future raises an exception then it is equivalent to ALL_COMPLETED.

ALL_COMPLETED

The function will return when all futures finish or are cancelled.

Unlike wait_for(), wait() does not cancel the futures when a timeout occurs.

Deprecated since version 3.8: If any awaitable in aws is a coroutine, it is automatically scheduled as a Task. Passing coroutines objects to wait() directly is deprecated as it leads to confusing behavior.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Note wait() schedules coroutines as Tasks automatically and later returns those implicitly created Task objects in (done, pending) sets. Therefore the following code won’t work as expected:
async def foo():
    return 42

coro = foo()
done, pending = await asyncio.wait({coro})

if coro in done:
    # This branch will never be run!
Here is how the above snippet can be fixed:

async def foo():
    return 42

task = asyncio.create_task(foo())
done, pending = await asyncio.wait({task})

if task in done:
    # Everything will work as expected now.
Deprecated since version 3.8: Passing coroutine objects to wait() directly is deprecated.

asyncio.as_completed(aws, *, loop=None, timeout=None)
Run awaitable objects in the aws set concurrently. Return an iterator of Future objects. Each Future object returned represents the earliest result from the set of the remaining awaitables.

Raises asyncio.TimeoutError if the timeout occurs before all Futures are done.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

Example:

for f in as_completed(aws):
    earliest_result = await f
    # ...
Scheduling From Other Threads
asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro, loop)
Submit a coroutine to the given event loop. Thread-safe.

Return a concurrent.futures.Future to wait for the result from another OS thread.

This function is meant to be called from a different OS thread than the one where the event loop is running. Example:

# Create a coroutine
coro = asyncio.sleep(1, result=3)

# Submit the coroutine to a given loop
future = asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro, loop)

# Wait for the result with an optional timeout argument
assert future.result(timeout) == 3
If an exception is raised in the coroutine, the returned Future will be notified. It can also be used to cancel the task in the event loop:

try:
    result = future.result(timeout)
except asyncio.TimeoutError:
    print('The coroutine took too long, cancelling the task...')
    future.cancel()
except Exception as exc:
    print(f'The coroutine raised an exception: {exc!r}')
else:
    print(f'The coroutine returned: {result!r}')
See the concurrency and multithreading section of the documentation.

Unlike other asyncio functions this function requires the loop argument to be passed explicitly.

New in version 3.5.1.

Introspection
asyncio.current_task(loop=None)
Return the currently running Task instance, or None if no task is running.

If loop is None get_running_loop() is used to get the current loop.

New in version 3.7.

asyncio.all_tasks(loop=None)
Return a set of not yet finished Task objects run by the loop.

If loop is None, get_running_loop() is used for getting current loop.

New in version 3.7.

Task Object
class asyncio.Task(coro, *, loop=None, name=None)
A Future-like object that runs a Python coroutine. Not thread-safe.

Tasks are used to run coroutines in event loops. If a coroutine awaits on a Future, the Task suspends the execution of the coroutine and waits for the completion of the Future. When the Future is done, the execution of the wrapped coroutine resumes.

Event loops use cooperative scheduling: an event loop runs one Task at a time. While a Task awaits for the completion of a Future, the event loop runs other Tasks, callbacks, or performs IO operations.

Use the high-level asyncio.create_task() function to create Tasks, or the low-level loop.create_task() or ensure_future() functions. Manual instantiation of Tasks is discouraged.

To cancel a running Task use the cancel() method. Calling it will cause the Task to throw a CancelledError exception into the wrapped coroutine. If a coroutine is awaiting on a Future object during cancellation, the Future object will be cancelled.

cancelled() can be used to check if the Task was cancelled. The method returns True if the wrapped coroutine did not suppress the CancelledError exception and was actually cancelled.

asyncio.Task inherits from Future all of its APIs except Future.set_result() and Future.set_exception().

Tasks support the contextvars module. When a Task is created it copies the current context and later runs its coroutine in the copied context.

Changed in version 3.7: Added support for the contextvars module.

Changed in version 3.8: Added the name parameter.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop parameter.

cancel()
Request the Task to be cancelled.

This arranges for a CancelledError exception to be thrown into the wrapped coroutine on the next cycle of the event loop.

The coroutine then has a chance to clean up or even deny the request by suppressing the exception with a try … … except CancelledError … finally block. Therefore, unlike Future.cancel(), Task.cancel() does not guarantee that the Task will be cancelled, although suppressing cancellation completely is not common and is actively discouraged.

The following example illustrates how coroutines can intercept the cancellation request:

async def cancel_me():
    print('cancel_me(): before sleep')

    try:
        # Wait for 1 hour
        await asyncio.sleep(3600)
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print('cancel_me(): cancel sleep')
        raise
    finally:
        print('cancel_me(): after sleep')

async def main():
    # Create a "cancel_me" Task
    task = asyncio.create_task(cancel_me())

    # Wait for 1 second
    await asyncio.sleep(1)

    task.cancel()
    try:
        await task
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print("main(): cancel_me is cancelled now")

asyncio.run(main())

# Expected output:
#
#     cancel_me(): before sleep
#     cancel_me(): cancel sleep
#     cancel_me(): after sleep
#     main(): cancel_me is cancelled now
cancelled()
Return True if the Task is cancelled.

The Task is cancelled when the cancellation was requested with cancel() and the wrapped coroutine propagated the CancelledError exception thrown into it.

done()
Return True if the Task is done.

A Task is done when the wrapped coroutine either returned a value, raised an exception, or the Task was cancelled.

result()
Return the result of the Task.

If the Task is done, the result of the wrapped coroutine is returned (or if the coroutine raised an exception, that exception is re-raised.)

If the Task has been cancelled, this method raises a CancelledError exception.

If the Task’s result isn’t yet available, this method raises a InvalidStateError exception.

exception()
Return the exception of the Task.

If the wrapped coroutine raised an exception that exception is returned. If the wrapped coroutine returned normally this method returns None.

If the Task has been cancelled, this method raises a CancelledError exception.

If the Task isn’t done yet, this method raises an InvalidStateError exception.

add_done_callback(callback, *, context=None)
Add a callback to be run when the Task is done.

This method should only be used in low-level callback-based code.

See the documentation of Future.add_done_callback() for more details.

remove_done_callback(callback)
Remove callback from the callbacks list.

This method should only be used in low-level callback-based code.

See the documentation of Future.remove_done_callback() for more details.

get_stack(*, limit=None)
Return the list of stack frames for this Task.

If the wrapped coroutine is not done, this returns the stack where it is suspended. If the coroutine has completed successfully or was cancelled, this returns an empty list. If the coroutine was terminated by an exception, this returns the list of traceback frames.

The frames are always ordered from oldest to newest.

Only one stack frame is returned for a suspended coroutine.

The optional limit argument sets the maximum number of frames to return; by default all available frames are returned. The ordering of the returned list differs depending on whether a stack or a traceback is returned: the newest frames of a stack are returned, but the oldest frames of a traceback are returned. (This matches the behavior of the traceback module.)

print_stack(*, limit=None, file=None)
Print the stack or traceback for this Task.

This produces output similar to that of the traceback module for the frames retrieved by get_stack().

The limit argument is passed to get_stack() directly.

The file argument is an I/O stream to which the output is written; by default output is written to sys.stderr.

get_coro()
Return the coroutine object wrapped by the Task.

New in version 3.8.

get_name()
Return the name of the Task.

If no name has been explicitly assigned to the Task, the default asyncio Task implementation generates a default name during instantiation.

New in version 3.8.

set_name(value)
Set the name of the Task.

The value argument can be any object, which is then converted to a string.

In the default Task implementation, the name will be visible in the repr() output of a task object.

New in version 3.8.

classmethod all_tasks(loop=None)
Return a set of all tasks for an event loop.

By default all tasks for the current event loop are returned. If loop is None, the get_event_loop() function is used to get the current loop.

Deprecated since version 3.7, will be removed in version 3.9: Do not call this as a task method. Use the asyncio.all_tasks() function instead.

classmethod current_task(loop=None)
Return the currently running task or None.

If loop is None, the get_event_loop() function is used to get the current loop.

Deprecated since version 3.7, will be removed in version 3.9: Do not call this as a task method. Use the asyncio.current_task() function instead.

Generator-based Coroutines
Note Support for generator-based coroutines is deprecated and is scheduled for removal in Python 3.10.
Generator-based coroutines predate async/await syntax. They are Python generators that use yield from expressions to await on Futures and other coroutines.

Generator-based coroutines should be decorated with @asyncio.coroutine, although this is not enforced.

@asyncio.coroutine
Decorator to mark generator-based coroutines.

This decorator enables legacy generator-based coroutines to be compatible with async/await code:

@asyncio.coroutine
def old_style_coroutine():
    yield from asyncio.sleep(1)

async def main():
    await old_style_coroutine()
This decorator should not be used for async def coroutines.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: Use async def instead.

asyncio.iscoroutine(obj)
Return True if obj is a coroutine object.

This method is different from inspect.iscoroutine() because it returns True for generator-based coroutines.

asyncio.iscoroutinefunction(func)
Return True if func is a coroutine function.

This method is different from inspect.iscoroutinefunction() because it returns True for generator-based coroutine functions decorated with @coroutine.

Three more challenges you may encounter include:

Scheduling—A distributed system has to decide which jobs need to run, when they should run, and where they should run. Schedulers ultimately have limitations, leading to underutilized hardware and unpredictable runtimes.
Latency—The more widely your system is distributed, the more latency you can experience with communications. This often leads to teams making tradeoffs between availability, consistency, and latency.
Observability—Gathering, processing, presenting, and monitoring hardware usage metrics for large clusters is a significant challenge.
How a Distributed System Works
Hardware and software architectures are used to maintain a distributed system. Everything must be interconnected—CPUs via the network and processes via the communication system.

Producer Mel Gibson will not be using paid advertisements to promote The Passion of the Christ to voters in next year's Academy Awards.

Gibson and his Icon Productions partner Bruce Davey said they would not be campaigning in print, radio or TV for success at the Oscars in February. "This film should be judged on its artistic merit, not who spends more money on advertising," Davey said. But DVDs will be sent to Oscar voters, who will be invited to screenings. Icon spent very little on advertising the film, which deals with the last hours of Jesus Christ's life, when it was released earlier this year - instead, it made the film available for special screenings at churches. It went on to gross over $600m (£322m) in ticket sales worldwide. Over recent years, marketing films to the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has become a multi-million dollar industry. Last year, the academy formed a committee to tighten the rules after the campaigns spilled over into personal attacks between studios. Academy president Frank Pierson praised Gibson's move for working to restore the Oscars as a "celebration and appreciation of excellence," and resisting the "crass commercialisation that was threatening the integrity of the award".

No UK premiere for Rings musical

The producers behind the Lord of the Rings musical have abandoned plans to premiere the show in London because no suitable theatre was available.

The £11.5m show will make its debut in Toronto in March 2006, after it was found that all three West End theatres with sufficient capacity were booked. The musical is not expected in London before December 2006. Producer Kevin Wallace said it would be "worth waiting for". "It will be like nothing they have ever seen before." "I know there will be a lot of disappointed British Tolkien fans who hoped to see the show in London, but we couldn't get a London theatre in time," added the British producer. The world premiere of the stage musical, co-produced by Canadian theatrical impresarios David and Ed Mirvish, will take place at Toronto's Princess of Wales Theatre next year.

"Toronto really wanted this premiere. The Tolkien books and films are hugely popular in Canada," said Mr Wallace, shortly after signing the deal in Canada. "We hope the anticipation and excitement over here will create an even bigger buzz by the time we open in London." Auditions begin in Canada on Thursday, but up to five British actors may join the cast, under a deal struck with Canadian Actors' Equity. The music for the show is being written by Bollywood composer AR Rahman, who was behind Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End musical Bollywood Dreams, and in conjuction with the Finnish group Varttina.

"There will be no singing and dancing Hobbits. The music will be in a very traditional mould and draw on ethnic traditions," assured Mr Wallace. The musical's British director is Matthew Warchus, best known for staging the worldwide stage hit Art. "The production will be a hybrid of text, physical theatre, music and spectacle never previously seen on this scale," he said. "Only in the theatre are we actually plunged into the events as they happen. The environment surrounds us and we are in Middle Earth." New Zealander Peter Jackson took 10 years to bring JRR Tolkien's fantasy trilogy to the big screen, winning Academy Awards for best film and best director for the final film The Return of the King in 2004.

Auditions begin in Canada on Thursday, but up to five British actors may join the cast, under a deal struck with Canadian Actors' Equity. The music for the show is being written by Bollywood composer AR Rahman, who was behind Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End musical Bollywood Dreams, and in conjuction with the Finnish group Varttina.

"There will be no singing and dancing Hobbits. The music will be in a very traditional mould and draw on ethnic traditions," assured Mr Wallace. The musical's British director is Matthew Warchus, best known for staging the worldwide stage hit Art. "The production will be a hybrid of text, physical theatre, music and spectacle never previously seen on this scale," he said. "Only in the theatre are we actually plunged into the events as they happen. The environment surrounds us and we are in Middle Earth." New Zealander Peter Jackson took 10 years to bring JRR Tolkien's fantasy trilogy to the big screen, winning Academy Awards for best film and best director for the final film The Return of the King in 2004.
No ads for Passion Oscar campaign

Producer Mel Gibson will not be using paid advertisements to promote The Passion of the Christ to voters in next year's Academy Awards.

Gibson and his Icon Productions partner Bruce Davey said they would not be campaigning in print, radio or TV for success at the Oscars in February. "This film should be judged on its artistic merit, not who spends more money on advertising," Davey said. But DVDs will be sent to Oscar voters, who will be invited to screenings. Icon spent very little on advertising the film, which deals with the last hours of Jesus Christ's life, when it was released earlier this year - instead, it made the film available for special screenings at churches. It went on to gross over $600m (£322m) in ticket sales worldwide. Over recent years, marketing films to the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has become a multi-million dollar industry. Last year, the academy formed a committee to tighten the rules after the campaigns spilled over into personal attacks between studios. Academy president Frank Pierson praised Gibson's move for working to restore the Oscars as a "celebration and appreciation of excellence," and resisting the "crass commercialisation that was threatening the integrity of the award".

No UK premiere for Rings musical

The producers behind the Lord of the Rings musical have abandoned plans to premiere the show in London because no suitable theatre was available.

The £11.5m show will make its debut in Toronto in March 2006, after it was found that all three West End theatres with sufficient capacity were booked. The musical is not expected in London before December 2006. Producer Kevin Wallace said it would be "worth waiting for". "It will be like nothing they have ever seen before." "I know there will be a lot of disappointed British Tolkien fans who hoped to see the show in London, but we couldn't get a London theatre in time," added the British producer. The world premiere of the stage musical, co-produced by Canadian theatrical impresarios David and Ed Mirvish, will take place at Toronto's Princess of Wales Theatre next year.

"Toronto really wanted this premiere. The Tolkien books and films are hugely popular in Canada," said Mr Wallace, shortly after signing the deal in Canada. "We hope the anticipation and excitement over here will create an even bigger buzz by the time we open in London." Auditions begin in Canada on Thursday, but up to five British actors may join the cast, under a deal struck with Canadian Actors' Equity. The music for the show is being written by Bollywood composer AR Rahman, who was behind Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End musical Bollywood Dreams, and in conjuction with the Finnish group Varttina.
